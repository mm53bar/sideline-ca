title: Asides

An *aside* is a brief comment that passes on small bits of information. While useful, asides don't have enough content for an entire conversation.  Interesting links, event descriptions, useful code and other smallish items are what you'll find in here.

If you're lucky, you might even find the odd bit of commentary that isn't interesting enough for an entire article.
