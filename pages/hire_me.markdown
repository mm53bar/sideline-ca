title: Hire Me! 

If you'd like to hire me, you've reached the right place.

I'm most interested in working with software development teams that are struggling to get better.  Typical signs that a team needs help are:

* continually missing project deadlines
* unable to estimate effectively
* perpetually busy but never really accomplishing anything
* no passion for work
