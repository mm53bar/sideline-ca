title: Beat up Melissa!
wordpress_url: http://blog.sideline.ca/2004/09/27/beat-up-melissa/

<a href="http://www.melissasroadrace.ca">Melissa's 10K</a> was a lot of fun.  I hadn't trained much, so I was happy with our time of 1:01:29.  That's a 9:54/mile  (6.11/km) pace.  See all the results (including Cindy's official result) at <a href="http://www.raceheadquarters.com/results/2004/run/mel10.htm">http://www.raceheadquarters.com/results/2004/run/mel10.htm</a>.
<br /><br />
We were told that they weren't selling any extra numbers, so we were forced to ghost run the race.  Oh well - it's tough to pick out a couple of cheaters in a race of 3000 people!
<br /><br />
All in all it was a great time as usual and I can't wait to do it again next year.
