<p>From <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0201710919/">Planning Extreme Programming</a> by Kent Beck and Martin Fowler:<br /><br />When you are overloaded, don't think of it as not having enough time; think of it as having too much to do.

<p>I'm constantly finding that I'm too busy and caught up in the game of doing everything.  I've tried to manage this by dropping things that don't add enough value (being President of <a title="" href="http://www.edmug.net">edmug.net</a> and a side business venture where the first casualties).  But I'm still going to find that I'm running out of time so I like this idea of switching my perspective.</p>
