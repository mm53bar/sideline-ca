<p>In my <a href="http://www.sideline.ca/2007/05/07/flickrmate-test/" title="sideline.ca  &raquo; FlickrMate Test">original test</a>, <a href="http://blog.circlesixdesign.com/download/flickrmate-bundle-for-textmate/" title="Circle Six Blog   &raquo; FlickrMate Bundle for TextMate">FlickMate</a> wasn't able to upload one of my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aream/sets/72157594534870603/" title="Photobooth - a photoset on Flickr">PhotoBooth pictures</a>.  After a few emails back and forth with the author this morning, I was given an updated version that works!  Here's the proof:</p>
<p><a href="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/222/489931543_0a5e562d5e.jpg" title="Sam finds that there's much less mess if he strips down before doing the dishes."><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/222/489931543_0a5e562d5e_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="How do you do the dishes?" /></a></p>
<p>I'm sure that you can expect Brett to post an updated version soon.  I highly recommend this bundle not just for the time-saving function that it provides but also because of Brett's fantastic support!</p>
