title: Scrum so far

<p><img alt="" hspace="10" src="http://images.despair.com/products/demotivators/change.jpg" align="left" vspace="10" border="0" />It's been almost 3 months since I put my ass on the line and forced all software development at <a title="TG - Where I work" href="http://www.telusgeomatics.com">TG</a> to use Scrum.  In that time, there have been highs and lows.  There have been stories added and stories dropped.  There have been overestimates and underestimates.  But overall I'd have to brand it a success.</p>
<p>The beautiful thing about Scrum is that it doesn't actually do anything.  All it does is push you towards releasing a production-ready application every iteration.  Once you've done that, then you take a step back so that you can inspect and adapt the process.  Then you do another iteration.  Repeat until you're done.</p>
<p>During this rinse-and-repeat process over the last few months, I've seen a lot of change.  I've seen PM's get involved with the developers.  I've seen QA get involved with the product owners.  I've seen more cooperation and collaboration in the last 2 months than I've seen in the last 2 years.</p>
<p>But what I've really found amazing is how good it feels to say 'yes' when somebody asks me for a new feature.  Even though there are still hurdles and change is a constant, I feel more optimistic than I have in years.  But maybe I just haven't seen the jaws of defeat yet.</p>
