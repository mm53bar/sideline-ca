title: Agile Edmonton's First Social Night
excerpt: |-
  <a href="http://www.agileedmonton.org">Agile Edmonton</a> meetings can be quick affairs.  Folks show up at noon for a one hour presentation and then rush back to work at 1:00.  While these lunchtime meetings have allowed us to have some great crowds (55 people for Janet Gregory's presentation), it doesn't allow for much networking.
  
  One of my goals for Agile Edmonton is to create an Agile community here in Edmonton.  So how can we create a community if we don't have any time for networking?  Simple - we add beer.  :)

Every quarter, Agile Edmonton will be hosting a Social Night.  I started calling it a beer night (or a booze schmooze), but Social Night is a much better name.  Our first Social Night will be in just a few days - Tuesday, February 17th at 5:30.  Come down to Hudson's Taphouse at 11248 104th Avenue.  TekSystems is sponsoring the event and will be providing beer and food.

Hope to see you there!
