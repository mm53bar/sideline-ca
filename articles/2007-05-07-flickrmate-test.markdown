<p>For the past couple of months, I've been blogging use <a href="http://macromates.com/">TextMate</a> for the Mac.  Everyone knows that it's the <a href="http://www.loudthinking.com/arc/000270.html">best editor for Rails development</a> but few know that it's a great blogging client too!  Give it a try.</p>
<p>But this post is a test of <a href="http://blog.circlesixdesign.com/download/flickrmate-bundle-for-textmate/">FlickrMate</a>, a free bundle to TextMate that allows me to integrate <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aream/">Flickr</a> into creating my blog posts.  Hopefully it works out as well as TextMate has.</p>
