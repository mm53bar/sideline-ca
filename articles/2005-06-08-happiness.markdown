<p>Since becoming a manager at work and a soon-to-be dad at home, I've been giving happiness a lot of thought.  </p>
<p>For the longest time, work happiness to me has been a challenging job that gives me an opportunity to learn while still being able to strut my stuff.    Lately, I'm not sure that I'm still getting that.  I certainly still have the challenge, but it's not a challenge that I can run with on my own anymore.  My challenge now is to motivate 20 other folks of varying experience and ability to share the same passion and drive that I do to make amazing web-based software.  That's easier said than done some days.  However, that's a million times easier (and more fun) than the other side of the job - dealing with the politics of the other managers.  I share a much closer vision with my developers than I do with the other managers.  I still have the passion and drive.  Hell, I even manage to have some vision every now and then.  But my new peer group doesn't have the same values as I do.  And I am desperate need of someone at my new level to share the dream!</p>
<p>Happiness at home is much easier to find.  I have a great supportive wife (thanks Sheila!) who has put herself aside during what is probably the most difficult time of her life.  While I've been moody and distant over the past 6 months, she has been fantastic.  Any semblance of mental stability that I still have is certainly indebted to her!  And I can't wait to have a kid.  I'm not really sure what to expect, but I suppose that's half the fun.</p>
<p>Overall, I would probably be able to improve my work life if I could just lower my expectations on myself.  I've heard that once you have kids, your perspectives change and work just doesn't mean as much anymore.  Maybe that's what I need ' a small, wrinkled poop machine that delivers my reality check.</p>
