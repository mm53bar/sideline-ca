title: So much time, so little blogging&#8230;
wordpress_url: http://blog.sideline.ca/2006/02/28/so-much-time-so-little-blogging/

<p>For the three of you that read my blog, you've probably noticed that I haven't been posting very much.  I was reminded of this fact by a couple of bozos (i.e. fellow developers in our tight-knit local community) at a .net user group meeting lately.</p>
<p>I've really struggled with what content I should focus on.  I'd love to provide non-stop killer technical content, but that's tough to do these days since my role as a manager precludes any coding.  That means that I have to make up all of my non-stop killer technical content at home.  With the arrival of Sammy 8 months or so ago, that's getting more and more difficult.</p>
<p>So, technical content might not be the best bet.  What else is there that I do where I can actually provide some sort of value to the blogosphere'  </p>
<p>Then it hit me ' I can share the experience that I've gained as I followed the road from an ASP developer to my current role as the manager of 20 .Net developers.  I've learned a ton through trial and error that might actually make for some interesting content.  Furthermore, I don't find a lot of blogs from people out there that actually have to manage developers.  Maybe it's a niche market that I can fill'</p>
