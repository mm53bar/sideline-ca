title: 3 Movies for the start of December
wordpress_url: http://blog.sideline.ca/2005/12/04/3-movies-for-the-start-of-december/

<p>Over the last few days, I've watched 3 movies:  <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0399295/">Lord of War</a>, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0399146/">A History of Violence</a>, and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0355295/">The Brothers Grimm</a>.  I don't think it's possible to combine three movies that have so little in common, but you can't be choosy when you're relying on the DivX gods.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0399295/">Lord of War</a> stars <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000115/">Nicolas Cage</a>.  That's pretty enough to guarantee that it's crap as far as I'm concerned.  But it didn't end up being too bad.  Nicolas Cage is a gunrunner supplying the world's wars with the artillery that they need.  His usual emotionless self actually worked well with the character.  The movie was interesting enough and had the 'based on real events' tagline but was just way too predicatable.  If you're interested in getting depressed or actually enjoy Nicolas Cage then you might enjoy this movie but otherwise I would only recommend it as a Sunday morning hangover flick.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0355295/">The Brothers Grimm</a> was about what I expected.  It was silly and over the top.  In the movie, Heath Ledger and Matt Damon are the Brothers Grimm ' two brothers that pull cons on simple townfolk in medieval Germany to make their living.  Sprinkled throughout the movie are snippets that are recognizable as <a href="http://www.nationalgeographic.com/grimm/">stories that the real Brothers Grimm wrote</a>.  This is a great movie for kids to watch while the adults play Cranium in the next room.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0399146/">A History of Violence</a> is the only movie out of this lot that I'd recommend.  It's been getting lots of press up here in Canada since it's actually done by <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000343/">a Canadian</a> and actually has some big stars in it (who mostly happen to be American).  It's hard to talk about the movie without giving away the main twist, but it was certainly enjoyable.  There's lots of bloodshed and even a full-frontal scene with <a href="http://www.cndb.com/actor.html'name=Bello%2C+Maria">Maria Bello</a> to keep everyone interested.  But for me, the highlight came (warning:  spoiler ahead) when William Hurt got shot in the head.  I can't stand that guy.</p>
<p>Overall, you should pass on Lord of War, rent The Brothers Grimm for the kids and save A History of Violence for yourself.</p>
