title: Max Payne 2 Rocks!
date: 2003/12/11

After being so disappointed by Deus Ex 2, I was a little scared going into Max Payne 2. MP2 doesn't have a lot of gameplay changes from the original MP, but it sure is nice that it works! It was also nice to see Pixel Shading as a video option!

I also grabbed the Game of the Year version of the original Deus Ex along with a great RC racing game called Re-Volt. I'm not much into racing games, but Re-Volt is a lot of fun.
