I'll be starting a new podcast soon, interviewing (mostly) local folks that are using Agile methods to deliver software.  The interviews will mainly focus on what type of software the company produces or works with, how Agile has helped the company, and what lessons they've learned that could benefit anybody going through an Agile adoption.  This theme of promoting education and awareness is a natural extension from the work that I've been doing with <a href="http://www.agileedmonton.org">Agile Edmonton</a> and the new consulting work that I'll be doing with <a href="http://www.quercussolutions.com">Quercus Solutions</a>.

The podcast will be called "Solid Solutions" and will be hosted on the Quercus Solutions website.  I've already had a chance to interview <a href="http://www.twitter.com/mastermaq">Mack Male</a> from <a href="http://www.questionmark.com">Questionmark</a> and <a href="http://www.twitter.com/jimwhitelaw">Jim Whitelaw</a> from <a href="http://www.bioware.com">BioWare</a>.  Mack's podcast is currently finished and simply awaiting the last steps of iTunes registration.  After that, I'll be getting Jim's podcast into editing.

Sound editing is something that I totally suck at.  I've chosen to use GarageBand on my Mac just because I already had it and it seems to have some great support for podcasting.  GarageBand actually makes the process pretty easy but it still takes a lot of time to go through and clean up any of the sound files. I'm slowly getting better at it so I hope that's reflected in the quality of the podcasts.

If you're interested in being interviewed as part of this podcast series, let me know.
