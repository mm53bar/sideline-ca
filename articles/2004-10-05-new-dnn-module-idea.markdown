title: New DNN module idea
wordpress_url: http://www.sideline.ca/2004/10/05/new-dnn-module-idea/

I used to use a program called CoolSync to [share bookmarks between work, home and the web](http://www.pcworld.com/resource/article.asp?aid=11168).  Unfortunately, just when I started to enjoy it, some big bad company bought it up and I lost my nice free access.

Good new though - [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us/doc/about) is here!  While it's a difficult URL to type, it's a neat concept - have a central place to store your bookmarks so that you can access them from anywhere.  Combine that with some nice category management and the ability to see other folks' bookmarks (who else is bookmarking the [Guinness World Record for longest toenails](http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/content_pages/record.asp?recordid=52883)?) and you've got yourself a sweet little system.

The last goodie will blow you away - RSS support.  Is that nice or what?

Anyways, along with the other "focussed RSS" modules that I'm building (.Text RSS and nGallery RSS), I'll probably add a del.icio.us RSS module too.

But the bigger project I'm thinking about is having a module that will allow a portal owner to create their own mini del.icio.us.  After all, it's just some attribute data i.e. bookmark name, URL, and one or more categories.  After that, building the RSS ain't too bad.  The inspiration for this comes from [this article on bookmarks with Sharepoint](http://weblogs.asp.net/jonathanh/archive/2004/06/14/155807.aspx).  I might also be able to use this [ASP.Net user control for del.icio.us](http://jacobcarpenter.com/blog/archive/2004/06/23/255.aspx) as a guide.  It also seems like [somebody has already created this type of module for Sharepoint](http://steve.wedevelop.net/archives/000250.html), so maybe there's some screenshots or source code just kicking around, eh?
