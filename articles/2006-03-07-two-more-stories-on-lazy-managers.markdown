title: Two more stories on lazy managers
wordpress_url: http://www.sideline.ca/2006/03/07/two-more-stories-on-lazy-managers/

<p>Over the weekend I ran across a couple more articles on the subject of delegating.  As I posted before, delegation is the key to becoming a lazy manager.  And for those of you that didn't read <a href="http://my.aream.ca/blogs/mike/archive/2006/03/02/15207.aspx">my first post</a>, being a lazy manager (or working for one) is a good thing.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://slackermanager.com/2005/04/give_it_away.html">first article</a> is by Slacker Manager and has a great quote right at the start:   'So here's the next step for the intrepid Slacker Manager in-training: give away all your work'.  He goes on to talk about how difficult it is to truly give away your work.  Overall, it's a good piece that helps to drive home some of these points that seem to be popping up on more and more blogs.</p>
<p>I'm sure that this isn't its original home, but the <a href="http://www.freebusinessforms.com/reports/35.html">second article</a> is hosted by FreeBusinessForms.com.  The author here contrasts the Lazy Manager with the Classic Manager.  Of course, I'm posting the article,  so you can guess the content.  If you said that the Classic Manager is overworked and does too much micro-management while the Lazy Manager delegates effectively and grows her team, then you're right.  If you guessed otherwise, then you're an idiot.  And no, I'm not going to write a post on how an Idiotic Manager is a good thing.</p>
<p>As I find more articles like this, I'll post them.  In the meantime, start applying this to your job.  Don't be a Classic Manager!  </p>
