title: Sin City almost made me puke!

<p>Just saw <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/sin_city/">Sin City</a> this past weekend.  I liked most of the movie.  Even though I had been somewhat warned, the whole scene with Elijah Wood grossed the hell out of me and almost made me puke in my seat.  I'd blame it on the popcorn but I felt fine later on in the movie, so it must have been good old Frodo himself.</p>
<p>Overall, it was a pretty cool movie.  I'm not a big comics fan and had never read this one ' apparently it's supposed to be referred to as a graphic novel.  Overall, life sucks in good old Basin City, everyone is corrupt and the good guys often get whacked once they've done their good deeds.  </p>
<p>A bit too much <em>graphic</em> violence for me.  I highlighted the word 'graphic' because I'm usually find with watching violent movies.  But rarely have I seen violent movies that were as downright gory as this one!</p>
<p>Overall, I'd definitely recommend it, but eat your popcorn quick so you can use the bucket for your puke.</p>
