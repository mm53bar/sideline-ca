<p>Sheila and I were over at some friends tonight and were trying to narrow down the top 10 moments that we've had with this particular group of folks.  Of course, we focussed on wild or zany moments that are once in a lifetime situations.  We had a good time thinking of all the fun times that we've had together.</p><p>That got me to thinking - what would be my own personal top 10 moments'  What are the 10 moments in my life that define me'  Of course, the easy answer is that the entire question is motivated by pop culture and not valid.  That may be true, but I think the spirit of the question is to look at your own life and pick out the highlights.</p><p>I'm not sure what my top 10 is but I'll post it here when I can come up with it.</p>
