title: A tiring night and day

<p>D-day is finally here.  Last night at 2:00 in the morning, Sheila woke me up to say that it was <a href="http://my.aream.ca/blogs/mike/archive/2005/01/16/255.aspx">time to go to the hospital</a>.  After being there for 5 hours, we were finally told to go home and wait it out since Sheila was only 2 cm dilated.</p>
<p>Well, we went home and hung around until 2:00 in the afternoon before finally going back. Almost as soon as we got there, Sheila started getting really bad contractions but was still only at cms.  After trying everything, we were finally admitted so that Sheila could try relaxing in the shower.  That didn't work too well, so they did another exam on her.  By this time, she was at 5 cm.  That meant that she qualified for an epidural.  After debating it for about 20 seconds (Sheila's scared to death of needles), she decided to do it.</p>
<p>The epidural worked out far easier than she thought and we're now just sitting around waiting for the baby to show up.  Sheila's now at 8 cms and we should be parents sometime around midnight.  I whisked home quick to let Tanna out for a quick pee before I head back to the hospital.</p>
<p>I'll post back tomorrow about how everything went!</p>
