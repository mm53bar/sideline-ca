<p>I found <a href="http://iqueryable.com/2007/02/15/AreYouAShipper.aspx">another article today</a> that can help me to create a good definition for <a href="http://www.sideline.ca/2007/04/08/what-does-done-mean">Done</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
	Those of us living in the world of software need to remember why we're in this business.  It's not about process, it's not about methodology, it's not about how Agile you are. It's about creating kick ass software that users love.  Users can't fall in love with something that isn't shipped.
