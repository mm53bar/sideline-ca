title: Finish line at Melissa&#8217;s
wordpress_url: http://blog.sideline.ca/2004/10/05/finish-line-at-melissas/

<p><img alt="" hspace="5" src="http://my.aream.ca/blogs//BlogImages/melissas_2004.jpg" align="left" border="0" />Just got this great finish line pic from the <a href="http://www.melissasroadrace.ca/">Melissa's 2004 race</a>.  Unfortunately, Sheila's a bit cut off the side, but Cindy made it in.  It's nice to get at least 1 picture though - I usually <a href="http://my.aream.ca/photos/albums/38.aspx">take pictures on other races</a>, but I forgot to bring the camera on this one.</p><p>One thing about Melissa's - great scenery!  Mountains everywhere.  On top of that, a can of beer is only $2 at the finish line!!  Sweet! <img src="http://my.aream.ca/blogs//BlogImages/smile18.gif" /></p><br />NOTE:  I had to repost this since the original got all messed up when I tried to edit it!  Crap.
