<p>In the big scheme of bathrooms, they really break down into 3 categories:  private, semi-private and public.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.toiletmuseum.com/lgpic.php'photo=celebrity/jenny2.jpg"><img alt="" hspace="5" src="http://www.toiletmuseum.com/celebrity/jenny.jpg" align="right" vspace="5" border="0" /></a>Private</strong><br />Private is the bathroom that you have at home or at the home of friends and family.  It's private and usually has a lock on the door.  When you're at the home of friends and family, it can be your sole refuge in the house ' a chance to get some time away from the nattering of everyone else.  At home, it's a great spot to read the morning paper.  :-)</p>
<p><strong>Semi-Private</strong><br />Semi-private is the bathroom at work.  You don't have to deal with riff-raff off the street coming in, but you do have to deal with the riff-raff from your workplace.  For me, I'm always amazed at the power of some of these guys' butts.  How do they spray crap all over the back of the seat'  It's astounding to me.  The semi-private bathroom isn't overly nice, but you don't want to spend too much time there.</p>
<p>When I was at Suncor in Fort Mac, I had the bathroom cleaning schedule down pat.  10:30 and 2:30 was my mantra.  Those were the times when the cleaning staff came in and hosed down the entire bathroom.  Getting in there at 10:35 was a guarantee for a nice clean visit.  At my current job at TELUS, I'm lucky if they clean the bathrooms twice a week, let alone twice a day.</p><a href="http://www.toiletmuseum.com/lgpic.php'photo=celebrity/train2.jpg"><img height="146" alt="" hspace="5" src="http://www.toiletmuseum.com/celebrity/train.jpg" width="216" align="left" vspace="5" border="0" /></a> 
<p><strong>Public</strong><br />Public is the bathroom of least resort.  It's the bathroom at the mall, at the restaurant or at the bar.  There is such a stigma surrounding this bathroom experience that there even <a href="http://www.crazyhill.com/hung/other_game/urinal.swf">instructional aids</a> available!  This is the type of bathroom where you're not sure if washing your hands will make you cleaner or dirtier.  If at all possible, hold it until you get to a private or semi-private bathroom.</p>
<p>But if you have to do it here, don't wuss out with those cheesy toilet seat covers and hand sanitizer.  I've blogged about the hand sanitizer addiction before (<a href="http://my.aream.ca/blogs/mike/archive/2004/09/14/157.aspx">here</a> and <a href="http://my.aream.ca/blogs/mike/archive/2004/09/14/158.aspx">here</a>).  Take it like a man'<a href="http://toddlerstoday.com/resources/articles/germsgood.htm">or a toddler</a>.</p>
<p>I've heard that women tend to do the squat thing in public bathrooms.  I've also heard that their aim is so bad that they make the public bathroom experience even worse for the next person.</p></blockquote>
<p>Lately, I've been reassigned during the TELUS strike.  The building I'm in now has 2 people ' me and a female co-worker.  That means that I get the men's bathroom to myself.  It's a confusing combination of semi-private and private.  I kind of like it but if the strike is actually over, I'll have to shift right back into semi-private mode.  Crap.</p>
