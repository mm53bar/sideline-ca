<p>Well, Sheila finally convinced me to go to the doctor. Not that I need to for any pressing reason. It's just that time in my life when I need to start considering that I'm not going to live forever.<img src="http://my.aream.ca/blogs/images/smile3.gif" /></p><p>So, she makes me an appointment with her doctor (who was highly recommended to her by a friend).  After her doctor made it very clear that I didn't need to get "<a href="http://my.webmd.com/hw/health_guide_atoz/tp10654.asp'printing=">the finger</a>" because I'm not 40 yet, my mind was a bit more at ease.  In fact, I (like most other guys) have a myriad of health issues that I should see a doctor for.  But, I still wouldn't go without Sheila's prodding.  Don't ask me why.  Go check <a href="http://www.spiketv.com/shows/events/pro_social/2004/lists.jhtml'id=">SpikeTV's list of reasons that guys don't go to the doctor</a>.</p><p>And I must say, my original logic proved to be correct.  My family has no life-threatening health issues that might affect me.  My consumption of booze is well within the <a href="http://www.drinkingandyou.com/site/uk/biggy.htm">recommended two drinks per day</a>, my diet is veggy so I don't stand much of a chance of getting too obese and I keep moderately active with volleyball and <a href="http://my.aream.ca/photos/albums/38.aspx">running</a>.  Everything is going swimmingly, including a reminder that "<a href="http://my.webmd.com/hw/health_guide_atoz/tp10654.asp'printing=">the finger</a>" isn't needed.  And then she drops the bomb - while I'm too young to bother checking for prostate cancer, I'm a prime candidate for cancer of "<a href="http://tcrc.acor.org/testicle.html">the boys</a>".  Nice.  So instead of her <a href="http://my.webmd.com/hw/colorectal_cancer/hw4404.asp">feeling me up from behind</a>, she'll <a href="http://tcrc.acor.org/tcexam.html">do it from the front</a>.</p><p>Why did I ever listen to Sheila'  Or even <a href="http://www.spiketv.com/shows/events/pro_social/2004/pdf/10ptcard_english.pdf">SpikeTV</a>'</p>
