<p>Read the article <a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/posts/386-dont-be-a-hero-giving-up-is-good">Don't be a hero: Giving up is good</a>.  Then read the <a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/posts/386-dont-be-a-hero-giving-up-is-good?54#comments">comments</a>.  Then give your head a quick shake.</p>

<p>I was astounded at how many of the commenters can't make a business decision to save their lives.  Rather than focussing on value for the client (and helping to turn a profit for their company), they wanted to chase a difficult problem because it was geeky cool.  To me, this is just plain wrong.</p>

<p>Why is it that the software development field seems to be populated by so many adrenaline junkies?  I'm the first to admit that I love my job because I essentially get paid for doing my hobby.  But there comes a point when you have to set aside the hobby part of the job (i.e. the thrill seeking) and remind yourself that being a professional means making decisions based on business value.</p>

<p>Is this really that hard?  Am I completely out to lunch?</p>
