title: Make Your Developers More Productive in 2 Easy Steps

Let's just cut to the chase here: your developers aren't as productive as you (or they) would like because they are working on too many things at the same time and they don't always choose the right things to work on.  It's often that simple.

One of my favourite lines to use is "if it hurts when you do that, stop doing that."  Unfortunately, many software teams (and companies) don't follow this common sense advice.  During the last year, I've started working with a couple of clients that both suffer from the same affliction: the devs can't finish anything.  

The solution to this is actually pretty easy:

* Allow your developers to only work on one thing at a time
* Make it easy for your developers to know what they should work on next

Seems pretty simple, right?  In fact, it seems simple enough that everyone should be doing it.  But here's the problem - almost nobody is.
