<p><img alt="" hspace="10" src="http://static.flickr.com/55/148739911_e1f7df6ce5_o.jpg" align="left" vspace="10" border="0" />I can't believe that anybody would have <a href="http://www.kbcafe.com/rss/'guid=20060518051656">more than 1000 blogs</a> that they subscribe to.  How do they keep track of them all'  These guys definitely don't have their <a href="http://blogs.sideline.ca/archive/2006/05/16/TheKISSprinciple.aspx">ambitions in check</a>.</p>
<p>And I thought that I was crazy with <a href="http://share.opml.org/viewsharedfeeds/'user_id=3050">150 blogs</a>.  I've got to slim down to <a href="http://share.opml.org/viewsharedfeeds/'user_id=3043">129 blogs</a> like the <a href="http://www.igloocoder.com/">IglooCoder</a>.  Man, that guy is kicking my ass.</p>
