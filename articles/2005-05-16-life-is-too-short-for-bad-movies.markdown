title: Life is too short for bad movies
wordpress_url: http://blog.sideline.ca/2005/05/16/life-is-too-short-for-bad-movies/

<p>A bunch of years ago, Sheila and I went to a movie.  Sheila picked the movie and I have never let her forget it.</p>
<p>The movie was <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113845/">Money Train</a> and was possibly the worst movie that I have ever seen.  Wesley Snipes and Woody Harrelson were on the downward slopes of their careers while Jennifer Lopez was on the upswing.  Regardless, the movie trash.</p>
<p>I've talked to a lot of people about Money Train.  I've heard a lot of opinions on it that range from 'Yeah, it was brutal' to 'Are you crazy'  It was awesome!'.  I've also noticed over the years that my own opinion of a movie tends to be affected by the expectations that I had for it.  If I thought that it would be a good movie and it was only so-so, I'll rank it as a stinker.  Conversely, there's some movies that I quite like that are ranked by others as stinkers ' obviously I had lower expectations for those flicks.</p>
<p>That's why I'm so disappointed by this weekend.  I watched two movies ' <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0377471/">Be Cool</a> and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0349903/">Ocean's Twelve</a>.</p>
<p>Be Cool is a loose sequel to <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113161/">Get Shorty</a>, a movie that I've never seen but is on my list.  Get Shorty had so many good reviews that I wanted to see Be Cool.  It also helped that a friend of mine saw Be Cool and said that it was a kick-ass movie.  I should have remembered that this friend and I have radically different tastes in movies.</p>
<p>Ocean's Twelve is a sequel to <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0240772/">Ocean's Eleven</a>, a movie that I quite liked for its quirky characters, cool soundtrack and even cooler dialogue.  Seeing a fancy grift come together was impressive as well.  If only some of that would have come through in the second movie.</p>
<p>Both Be Cool and Ocean's Twelve suffered from the same fatal flaw ' they had no content!  Be Cool was some sort of rambling music video with a bunch of stars playing themselves.  Ocean's Twelve really had no point other than to have a scene where Julia Roberts got to play a character attempting to impersonate Julia Roberts.  They were both crap!  </p>
<p>While I was expecting something good from Be Cool (and was sorely disappointed), even a lack of expectations from Ocean's Twelve didn't help it.  I must admit that I was able to watch Ocean's Twelve from start to finish though.  Be Cool was an absolute chore to sit through and it was only through an amazing amount of personal drive and determination that I was able to keep my ass glued to the couch.</p>
<p>Anyways, I guess the short version of this is that Be Cool and Ocean's Twelve sucked.  Don't watch them!  And Money Train sucks too.</p>
