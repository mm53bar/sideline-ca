title: I should know better
wordpress_url: http://www.sideline.ca/2005/06/29/i-should-know-better/

<p>Over the last year at work, my development team has had a lot of success in implementing new tools.  It's hard to imagine life at work now without our daily builds in <a href="http://cruisecontrol.sourceforge.net/">CruiseControl</a>, <a href="http://nant.sourceforge.net/">NAnt</a>, <a href="http://ndoc.sourceforge.net/">NDoc</a>, <a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/fxcop/">FXCop</a>, and the occasional <a href="http://www.nunit.org/">NUnit</a> (or <a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/darrell.norton/articles/50337.aspx">TDD</a>) test.  Hell, even VSS is pretty new to us!</p>
<p>In the interviews that I hold with new applicants, I ask them if they've worked with any of these tools.  The experience varies, but all of them except for source control seem to be new to most interviewees.</p>
<p>Another stock interview question is 'Do you code at home''.  Most developers say 'yes', which brings me to my doozy question ' 'Do you use source control at home''.  I have never met one developer that answers yes to that question.  Stop for a second and think about that ' what would you think of a software company that didn't use source control'  I'm pretty sure that I know what you'd think - that they're a bunch of bloody fools!  So why is it different when you choose (and it is a choice!) not to use source control for your hobby coding at home'</p>
<p>Which made me start to think ' do I use any of our work tools at home'  Of course, the answer was no.  And you know what'  <em>I should know better</em>.  I'm not old enough to use the old line 'do as I say, not as I do', so I started to implement some of these tools in my home coding.</p>
<p>I use <a href="http://www.sourcegear.com/vault/">SourceGear Vault</a> for my source control.  It has a <a href="http://support.sourcegear.com/viewtopic.php't=252">free license if only one developer uses it</a>.  Lucky enough, I'm the only developer in my household software team! <img src="http://my.aream.ca/blogs/images/smile3.gif" />  We use VSS at work, so using Vault at home helps me to learn a different source control provider while still protecting my code.</p>
<p>I also use <a href="http://www.countersoft.com/">Gemini</a> for managing my tasks and workload.  I can't tell you how many times in the past I would think of some cool new feature for my hobby coding.  But of course, it would only exist in my head.  Sometimes I'd get high-tech with it and scribble it on some receipt that I had kicking around.  Or maybe it would go into some obscure text file that sat in My Documents with the hundreds of other fantastic ideas.  I think you're getting the picture ' I needed some organization.  Not the multi-level dependency level of organization that MS Project gives you.  I needed a nice and simple application that could track what I wanted to do and when I was doing it.  Gemini does this.</p>
<p>I've recently received an <a href="http://www.countersoft.com/Licensing.aspx">Open Source License for Gemini</a> on my home system for developing the <a href="http://www.dotnetnuke.com/">DNN 3</a> version of my <a href="http://aream.ca/DNN/PickEm/tabid/56/Default.aspx">Pick'Em module</a>.  I can't wait to start using it to track the future progress of this module.  It doesn't make me a better developer, but it makes me a bit more effective.  And that's a good start!</p>
<p>In the future, I'm hoping that FXCop, Nant, NDoc and CruiseControl start to show up on my system.  NUnit is something that I absolutely, positively must start using (once I learn how to!).  But I'm getting there.  </p>
