title: More ASP.Net Controls that I&#8217;m looking for
wordpress_url: http://blog.sideline.ca/2005/06/26/more-aspnet-controls-that-im-looking-for/

<p>I thought of another one of the <a href="http://my.aream.ca/blogs/mike/archive/2005/06/21/15092.aspx">ASP.Net Controls that I'm looking for</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://my.aream.ca/blogs/images/Cropper_20Capture[4].png"><img height="125" alt="Pick'Em Picks - the picks screen where you can choose the team that will win each game." hspace="10" src="http://my.aream.ca/blogs/images/Cropper_20Capture[4]_small.jpg" width="128" align="left" vspace="5" border="1" /></a>In my current Pick'Em pool, I have a list of games where users need to pick which team will win.  The interface consists of a simple repeater that lists the date &amp;amp; time, the teams and the venue for each game.  The picture on the left shows what it currently looks like.</p>
<p><em></em></p>
<p>But this isn't exactly what I need.  What I would like to have is a screen similar to what ESPN uses for their <a href="http://games.espn.go.com/pigskin/entry'entryID=197866&amp;amp;period=16">Pigskin Pick'em</a>.  For their game list, the group each of the games by date.  Each grouping has a special group header that lists the date.  Each entry in that group lists the time and the teams for the game.  Go to the <a href="http://games.espn.go.com/pigskin/entry'entryID=197866&amp;amp;period=16">Pigskin Pick'em</a> page to see how they do their grouping.</p>
<p>Now my brain starts to kick in and ask 'how do you build a grouping repeater''  In my younger and less wise days, I'd hit the code and start making something.  These days, I'm wiser and have the power of Google at my fingertips.  Lo and behold, <a href="http://www.dotnetjunkies.com/Article/4365153F-D2F5-4C77-9FE7-94DD1AAF6F98.dcik">a grouping repeater has already been built</a> and seems to have what I need.  It's a nice little tool that inherits from the base Repeater control and simply adds a ColumnToGroup property along with three new templates:  grouptemplate, grouptemplateheader and grouptemplatetotal.  Bundled along with the goodies that I'm looking for is the extra functionality to create subtotals for each group.  Not something that I need today, but who knows what tomorrow will bring, eh'</p>
<p>God bless the internet and all the friendly developers out there who are willing to share their creations!  I'll post back here once I've implemented this.</p>
