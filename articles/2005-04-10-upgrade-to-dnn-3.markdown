title: Upgrade to DNN 3!
wordpress_url: http://blog.sideline.ca/2005/04/10/upgrade-to-dnn-3/

<p>I finally did the upgrade to DNN 3 this weekend.  The upgrade itself was pretty easy except for running into a few quirks.  </p>
<p>For example, if I had disabled the title for a module in DNN 2, it seemed that the migration process just gave that module an empty container in DNN 3.  That meant that I didn't get any edit buttons and wasn't able to do much with the module other than delete it through the database.</p>
<p>I found updated versions of LinkImage and SimpleDownload to go along with the MultiPage Content module and a few others.</p>
