Late September means one thing - it's time to head to Banff for <a href="http://www.melissasroadrace.ca/">Melissa's Road Race</a>!  Sheila, Cindy and I <a href="http://my.aream.ca/photos/albums/21.aspx">did the 21K run last year</a> a week before <a href="http://my.aream.ca/photos/albums/5.aspx">we headed to Africa</a>.  This year, we're going to take it down a notch and do the 10K.

Melissa's is so popular that it sells out almost a year in advance.  Last year, Cindy "ghost ran" the run i.e. didn't pay to sign up but ran anyways.  This year, Cindy's signed up but Sheila and I weren't able to get in before it sold out.  We've heard a rumour that there's a way to sign up on the day of the race.  We'll cross our fingers since we've heard a different rumour that they're trying to crack down on ghost runners!
