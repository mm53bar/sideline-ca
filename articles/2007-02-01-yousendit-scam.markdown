title: YouSendIt Scam?
wordpress_url: http://www.sideline.ca/2007/02/01/yousendit-scam/

In the past, I've used the YouSendIt service to send large files around.  Their Lite account has some limitations to it so I was pleased when I got the following e-mail from them:
<blockquote><span style="margin: 10px 10px 10px 0px; display: block">Hello Mike,</span>

Your Lite account is great, but you deserve more. That's why we are giving you a free upgrade to our most powerful service, YouSendIt Business Plus, to experience the many benefits it provides. This is a $29.99 value and you get it absolutely free - no strings attached.

Compared to your current  account, some key advantages include the ability to: <span style="margin: 10px 10px 10px 0px; display: block"></span><span style="margin: 10px 10px 10px 0px; display: block"></span>
<ul>
	<li>Track file downloads</li>
	<li>Send multiple files at once</li>
	<li>Customize file deliveries with your logo</li>
	<li>Password protect your uploaded files</li>
</ul>
Plus, there are no ads on your pages or your recipient's download pages.

<span style="margin: 10px 10px 10px 0px; display: block">Hurry, this promotion ends soon.</span></blockquote>
"No strings attached" sounds pretty good so I logged in to get my upgrade.  Imagine my surprise when I saw the following:

In particular, I was a little confused at the "Upgrade valid for 30 days" note.  How does that jive with their earlier promise of "No strings attached"?

I tried to follow through the registration process to see what would happen.  After going through the process, I ended up getting the following message:  "Internal error.  Please try again later."  I'll give it a try later and see what happens.

I can handle scams from dirty startups and Nigerian spammers, but this doesn't bode well for YouSendIt's reputation if this ends up being a scam.
