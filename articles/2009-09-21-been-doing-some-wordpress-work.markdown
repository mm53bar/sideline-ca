title: Been doing some Wordpress work

I've been playing a lot with Wordpress recently.  I touched up the Arthemia theme on the [Agile Edmonton](http://www.agileedmonton.org) site, moved [my site](http://blog.sideline.ca) from the Copyblogger theme to the [Vigilance theme](http://themes.jestro.com/vigilance/), [customized](http://github.com/mm53bar/vigilance) the Vigilance theme a bit and then wrote up a couple of [widget](http://github.com/mm53bar/wp-sideline-recent-posts) [plugins](http://github.com/mm53bar/wp-sideline-annual-archives) for my sidebar.

One thing that I really like about the Wordpress framework is that I can play around with it quite a bit despite the fact that I'm just learning PHP.  The ease of customization was actually an unexpected bonus - I chose Wordpress because of the number of themes that are available for it.  While I like playing with design, I'm not very good at it so it was a bonus for me that Wordpress has such a huge number of available themes.
