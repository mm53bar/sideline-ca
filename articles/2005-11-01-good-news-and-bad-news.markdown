title: Good News and Bad News
wordpress_url: http://blog.sideline.ca/2005/11/01/good-news-and-bad-news/

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Well, I have some good news.  I'm not one to bitch for very long without looking for solutions, so I made an appointment last night to visit with my good friend, HeadHunter.  I also sent TheBoss the following e-mail:</font></p>
<blockquote>
<div align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">I was holding out hope that there would be a "yes" vote yesterday, but with the rejection I'm going to assume that I will be stuck in Norwood for a long time.</font></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"> </font></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Since I haven't really heard anything from you in the 6 weeks that I've been out here, I'm going to assume that there's zero chance of me getting involved in managing any software development activities.  As such, I'm starting a job search today to get me a job where I can actually do something that's related to software development.</font></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"> </font></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">My first choice is still to return to TG immediately.  But given the high demand for IT people in Edmonton right now, I'd be a fool to not look for other opportunities where I can actually use my skills.</font></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"> </font></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Just so you're aware that nothing is going on behind your back, I wanted to inform you of this and that I'll be meeting with HeadHunter later this afternoon to investigate my options.</font></div></blockquote>
<div align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">TheBoss quickly called me so that we could go chat over a beer.</font></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"></font> </div>
<div align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">It was a busy night!  First HeadHunter, then TheBoss, then Sheila had booked us in for some flu shots.  All of this on Halloween!</font></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"></font> </div>
<div align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">My meeting with HeadHunter was good.  He wanted to find out what I was looking for, both in terms of salary and job experience.  I think that HeadHunter has been a bit PO'd at me lately because I haven't hired too many of the guys that he's been sending my way.  But, I'm picky.  I'm proud to say that my hiring team is even more picky than I am!  :-)</font></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"></font> </div>
<div align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">After the meeting with HeadHunter, I was off to my meeting with TheBoss before heading out for flu shots.  That bad news of my story is that the flu shots ended up being more enjoyable than my meeting with TheBoss.</font></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"></font> </div>
<div align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">First of all, TheBoss spent a bunch of time saying that his hands were tied.  However, he mentioned that one of the other managers was able to return to TG and that I should focus my efforts on getting my group to let me go.  I reminded him that I had already accomplished that 2 months ago but TheBoss' bosses wouldn't let anyone come back.  His reply'  'Oh, yeah'.</font></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"></font> </div>
<div align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Then it started getting into the blame game.  TheBoss accused me of threatening him with my e-mail.  He said that all IT shops had problems and if I chose to run away from the problems here then I would probably find them somewhere else.  He mentioned that people have left TG in the past and then returned with their tail between their legs when the outside world ended up being not so rosey.</font></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"></font> </div>
<div align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">As I tried to swallow my temper, I was also foolish enough to start firing back.  We're a software shop that doesn't want to act like our main product is actually software.  There's no project management.  The dev team is improving every day but we're not seeing it from other groups.  I have never run away from any problem and have busted my ass to make TG better than it was when I got here.</font></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"></font> </div>
<div align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">I don't think that any of that really got through.</font></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"></font> </div>
<div align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">I've been told by many people not to argue with TheBoss.  It's better to slowly chip away at him than take him on directly.  I like to think that I've got a pretty deep well of patience, but the well had certainly run dry by the time he started sniping away at me.</font></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"></font> </div>
<div align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">At the end of it, we both agreed that each of us wanted the best for TG.  And that was that.  TheBoss has a meeting this morning with his boss where they are trying to figure out what to do now that the union rejected the deal.  TheBoss will give me a call after that's done.</font></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"></font> </div>
<div align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">At least I can finish with some more good news ' I'm feeling pretty good after the flu shot!  :-)</font></div>
