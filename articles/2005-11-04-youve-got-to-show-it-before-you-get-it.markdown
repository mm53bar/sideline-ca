title: You&#8217;ve got to show it before you get it

<p><a href="http://www.managementblog.org/archives/2005/11/04/not-a-gift-but-something-earned/"></a> I could not agree with this quote more:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Don't promote the person to test them. Test the person to earn the promotion.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>I had an argument with a past developer when I wouldn't promote them on a 'I'll show you what I can do' basis.  If you're not currently passing the tests in your current job, don't expect a promotion.</p>
<p>In order to get promoted, you need to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Exceed the expectations of your current job,</li>
<li>Show drive and passion, and</li>
<li>Do the work of your next job before you actually get it.</li></ol>
<p>I've found through experience that if you have somebody that should be promoted, you usually don't need to tell them about these three steps.  They're already doing them.</p>
<p>That's twice in a couple of weeks that I've quoted the <a href="http://www.managementblog.org/archives/2005/11/04/not-a-gift-but-something-earned/">Management Skills Blog</a>. Definitely a good one to add to your feed list.</p>
