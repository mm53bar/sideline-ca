<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointy_Haired_Boss"><img alt="" hspace="10" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/b8/The_boss_icon.gif" align="left" vspace="10" border="0" /></a>As a manager of software developers, I struggle with they best way to use the enormous power that I have.  :-)</p>
<p>I used to like thinking of myself as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_Dictator_for_Life">Benevolent Dictator</a>.  While I encourage people to offer their opinions, I'm a strong believer that democracy in the workplace is doomed to failure.  For those of you at <a title="TG - Where I work" href="http://www.telusgeomatics.com">TG</a> that disagree, just ask Glenn where your Dev Team jackets are.  I learned the lesson the hard way.</p>
<p>I've also identified with the role of a <a href="http://www.nerdherding.net/">NerdHerder</a>.  Nerd Herding is difficult.  Keeping developers together and moving in the same direction is a difficult task.  I also make it hard on myself by trying to hire developers that have a lot of passion and drive.  These types of nerds always have a new idea and want to implement it.  My best advice for this situation is to challenge the unruly nerd:  if he wants to strike out on a new path then he's got to take the rest of the herd with him.  This is a win-win situation for you ' either you've just created a new leader in your group or you've taught a developer a tough lesson.</p>
<p>Lately I've heard lots about <a href="http://www.greenleaf.org/leadership/servant-leadership/What-is-Servant-Leadership.html">Servant Leadership</a>.  I haven't read much about this and the little bit that I have read makes me feel that it's a bit to fluffy to work.  I do like the 'servant' part of it.  I've always thought that I work for my developers rather than vice versa.  They're the ones doing the work and what I need to do is make it as easy as possible for them to fulfill their goals.  However, I've never been able to implement this in every situation.  Every so often, I find I need to switch back to the Benevolent Dictator during a crunch time.</p>
<p>What type of leader do you like best'</p>
