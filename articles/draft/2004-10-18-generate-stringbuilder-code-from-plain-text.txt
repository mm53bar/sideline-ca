<p>This is a <a href="http://www.knowdotnet.com/articles/TextToStringBuilder.html">nice little freebie</a> - it allows you to generate the full stringbuilder code (either VB.Net or C#) from some sample text that you have.  Sweet if you were dumping some javascript or sql code into a string for god knows what reason!  Maybe you want to get yourself a spot on the <a href="http://thedailywtf.com/">dailyWTF</a>'</p><p>Seriously though, there are times when you have to build big strings and this would help.</p>
