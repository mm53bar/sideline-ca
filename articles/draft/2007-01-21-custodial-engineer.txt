EDIT #2:  It looks like the YouTube plugin only wanted the key for the video and not the entire URL.  You should now be able to enjoy the video right from this page.

EDIT #1: Apparently the youtube plugin that I'm using for wordpress isn't working properly. I'll keep playing with it but the video is at <font face="Arial" size="2"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SIpA9sow6Vo" onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SIpA9sow6Vo</a></font>

My brother just sent this link to me.  I haven't seen this video in a long time but it makes me laugh everytime.  I love when he says "poke check" and hits the guy with his mop.  Classic stuff.
