<p><img src="http://www.disneyhercs.com/Da.jpg" align="left" border="0" height="184" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="258" />Maybe Ive been hanging around with <a href="http://www.tonysoft.ca/blogs/tonys_blog/archive/2005/05/09/65.aspx">Tony</a> for too long, but just as I finally managed to get a few days off I caught a cold.</p>
<p>Now dont get me wrong  Im not down in the dumps about this.  In fact, I love being sick.</p>
<p>Being sick means that you can feel completely justified in staying
at home in your pyjamas, watching bad movies and drinking tea all
day.  Being sick means that you can shut off the entire outside
world because you need to rest and take care of yourself.</p>
<p>I caught the cold on Friday or Saturday and then was away from work
right through until Wednesday.  That gave me plenty of time for
lounging, sniffling and sleeping.  Youve got to love that.</p>
