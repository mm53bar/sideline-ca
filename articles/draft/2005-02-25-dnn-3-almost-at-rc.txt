<p>Posted <a href="http://www.asp.net/Forums/ShowPost.aspx'tabindex=1&amp;amp;PostID=734458">on the forums</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The 3.0.11 release will be the last *BETA* release for <a title="" href="http://www.dotnetnuke.com">DotNetNuke</a> 3.0. It has been a long journey... but the application has finally reached a level of stability which is acceptable for general distribution. We are pleased with the breadth of enhancements offered in 3.0 and hope the community appreciates the amount of effort encapsulated in this latest evolution. <br /><br />The only item remaining for <a title="" href="http://www.dotnetnuke.com">DotNetNuke</a> 3.0 FINAL is integration of an updated MemberRole component from Microsoft. The original MemberRole component was based on the Whidbey API from July 2004 and contained a EULA which did not allow for production use. The latest MemberRole component which we received yesterday, has been updated to conform to the most recent changes in the Whidbey API and contains a EULA which allows for production use. The integration and regression testing will likely take a couple weeks ( work is already underway in this area ). The good news is that because we essentially wrapped the MemberRole component and treated it as a "black box", the integration effort should be minimal. <br /><br />You can also expect a few other usability modifications in the final build. These are necessary to address some of the excellent feedback we have received from you in this Forum. Specifically we want to make the task of adding a new module to a page much more flexible and intuitive from a permissions perspective. We also want to improve the portability of skins by enhancing the parsing logic. <br /><br />We appreciate your ongoing commitment and patience and look forward to another growth year in 2005.</em></p></blockquote>
