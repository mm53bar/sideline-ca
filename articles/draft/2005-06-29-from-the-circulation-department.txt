<p><a href="http://my.aream.ca/blogs/images/IMG_7537.JPG"></a>We recently cancelled our subscription to the <a href="http://www.edmontonsun.com/">Edmonton Sun</a> (damn right-wing farmers) to take advantage of a TELUS Perk with the <a href="http://www.canada.com/national/nationalpost/index.html">National Post</a> (damn right-wing Ontarians).  </p>
<p>Today, we received our refund from the Sun, but not quite in the form that we expected!  </p><br />
