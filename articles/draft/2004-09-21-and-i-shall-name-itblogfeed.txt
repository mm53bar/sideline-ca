<p>I've been debating what to do with the XSLT that I built to display my .Text blog. I've decided that it's too hard to fit into the existing RSS feed module that comes with DNN. So, in the tradition of my XmlFeed and HtmlFeed, I'll create a new DNN module called BlogFeed.</p>
<p>It will essentially use the XSLT that I've shown here, but I'll add some customizability so that users can choose the different images that are used. As well, I'll need to check out the latest version of some of the blog RSS out there to see if there's any other XML fields that I can add in. Trackback is something that comes to mind.</p>
<p>hmmm....I guess another option that I could add is whether I should even show the sections that use the images (Posted By, Comments, etc.). Or maybe the order of them could be adjusted'</p>
<p>I'll be setting up some new tabs for all of my modules as well as the progress of any modules that are in the queue.</p>
