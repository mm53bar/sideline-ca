<p>I've got two new toys in my web browsing tickle trunk: <a href="http://www.gishpuppy.com/">GishPuppy</a> and <a href="http://www.bugmenot.com/">BugMeNot</a>. </p>
<p><img src="http://www.bugmenot.com/buttons/bugmenot_01.gif" align="right" border="0" hspace="10" vspace="10" />BugMeNot
is a service that helps you to bypass all of those annoying websites
out there that want you to sign up just so that you can have access to
some downloads.  CodeProject springs to mind here.</p>
<p>Next time you sign up to a site
with some fake information (Ive been Fred Test and lived at 100 Main
Street for longer than I can remember), head on over to bugmenot.com
and register that site and your fake information.  By doing that,
other users can then take advantage of this account.</p>
<p>BugMeNot is aided by a really
nice Firefox extension.  Simply click in the Username textbox of
the website and choose BugMeNot.  The extension goes to the
website, picks the first username/password combination and submits the
page with that information.  Voila  no messy signups.</p>
<p>Now the first thing that I
thought of when I saw this was.hey, this is just like those websites
that give out hacked passwords to porn sites!  Cool!  But the
BugMeNot folks must already be planning on the eventual lawsuits. 
This is from their <a href="http://www.bugmenot.com/faq.php">FAQ</a>:</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Are you going to steal my identity or rob my credit card'<br /><em>No.
Our policy forbids accounts to paid services from being posted.
However, just like a discussion forum, if you happen to find one then </em><a href="mailto:public@bugmenot.com"><em>email</em></a><em> and it will be removed. Privacy is not considered a commodity.</em></p>
<p><a name="16"></a>Are you going to bankrupt my paid content service'<br /><em>See above. If you are losing sleep over this then </em><a href="mailto:public@bugmenot.com"><em>email</em></a><em> the url and we'll add your site to the "automatically blocked" list.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>BugMeNot is highly recommended, even if it cant get me free passwords to porn sites.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.gishpuppy.com/images/partnerlogo.gif" align="left" border="0" hspace="10" vspace="10" />Ill let the GishPuppy folks describe their service:</p>
<p><em>GishPuppy
offers disposable email addresses that automatically forward messages
to your normal (private) email. Conveniently create a <u>different</u> GishPuppy email everytime you register on the web, and <u>individually</u> cancel them whenever you want. </em></p>
<p>You might think that GishPuppy
is kind of useless after hearing about BugMeNot.  But the great
thing about GishPuppy is that it allows you to sign up for services
that you might actually need.  These are the types of services
where youre OK signing up with personalized information (i.e. dont
use BugMeNot) but youre not comfortable enough to use your own
personal e-mail address.</p>
<p>Ive got tons of sites that ask
me to sign up and then hit me with spam-lite.  You all know what
spam-lite is.  Its not really spam because it consists of
semi-useful information hidden in newsletters, site updates, etc. 
Its information that could be moved into an RSS feed but that would
just be too easy and progressive, wouldnt it'</p>
<p>The really nice thing about
GishPuppy is the GishIt extension for Firefox.  Now when Im on a
site that I want to sign up to, I just right-click and choose
GishIt.  A small window pops up with the current sites
information (to help with searching later on) and a nice customized
GishPuppy e-mail is created for me to use in the signup process.</p>
<p>Ive already Gishd my
CodeProject, DotNetJunkies, SqlJunkies and ImageAfter
memberships.  This is a highly recommended service.</p>
