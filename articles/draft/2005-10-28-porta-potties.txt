<p><strong>Berg Lake Trail, Mt. Robson</strong> ' this was a beautiful porta-pottie.  It helped that it was on a flood plain and got flooded out every so often.  That can't be good for the environment but it was great for freshness!</p>
<p><strong>Watchtower Basin, Jasper</strong> ' the king of porta-potties.  It was just a big throne set into the side of a hill.  It had no roof or walls, so it allowed you to watch the wildlife and the sky as you did your business.  By far the best crap I've ever had.</p>
<p><strong>The beginning or end of every running race that I've ever been in</strong>.  These are usually pretty bad.  Runners get a little nervous before the run and usually suffer from 'runner's trots' ' you can imagine the result.</p>
<p><strong><img height="200" alt="" hspace="10" src="http://www.msgr.ca/msgr-humour/toilet%20paper.gif" width="180" align="left" vspace="5" border="0" />Hawaii</strong> ' a porta-pottie at the beginning of a hike (I think it was Angel Falls or something like that on the North Shore of Oahu).  This was the worst porta-pottie ever. Not only was it baking in the hot Hawaiian sun, but it wasn't really maintained so the contents were almost up to the seat.  Imagine the smell of that.  It got worse once you actually looked in the hole ' it was full of maggots and other creepy crawlies.  However, I had a 3'hour hike ahead of me so I had to get the business over with.  By far the worst crap I've ever had.</p>
<p>Of course, our trip to Africa also changed my views on a lot of bathroom issues.  Where I used to demand cleanliness, now I'm just happy to have a seat!  But in every single porta-pottie that I've ever used, you have to remember to bring your own T.P.!</p>
