Sports - CFL - News - CFL Week 16 Picks</a></p><p><em>TONIGHT <br />Calgary at Toronto, 6 p.m. Sportsnet <br />Bender: Miracle Matt is not going to beat the Boatmen with a third-string QB (Mike Souza) and a gutted defence. Argos by 10. <br />Penton: No Khari. No chance. Argos by 12. <br />Friesen: What were these two doing beating the Lions and Eskimos, respectively, last week' The big difference this week is the Stamps traded away the heart of their defence 24 hours later. Argos by 10. </em></p><em><p><br />FRIDAY <br />Edmonton at Hamilton, 5:30 p.m. TSN <br />Bender: Ticats could surprise Timid Tom after the Eskimos were shaken by the Argos at home but the Eskies still have more talent. Eskies by 7. <br />Penton: The Esks will rebound with a big effort against the Tabbies. Eskimos by 10. <br />Friesen: Not sure why, but I like the Ticats in the annual Hall-of-Fame game against an Edmonton team that looked brutal a week ago. Hamilton by 4. </p><p><br />SATURDAY <br />Montreal at Saskatchewan, 6 p.m. CBC/RDS <br />Bender: The 'Riders will need even more help from the skunk shirts if they think they can beat The Don's soaring Birds, but they do play them tough. Als by 7. <br />Penton: Les Alouettes should go play south of the border. They're too good for this league. Alouettes by 18. <br />Friesen: The Als' offence has officially arrived, and that's bad news for everybody else in the CFL. If they lose another one this season, it'll be next week in Edmonton. Montreal by 8. <br />Winnipeg at B.C., 9 p.m. CBC <br />Bender: The big deal will spark The Dogged Daley's troops but school's still out on that offence. And Wally Boo Boo has a way of rebounding from upsets like last week, especially at their dingy dome home. Leos by 4. <br />Penton: The big swap won't be enough to lift the Bombers to victory. Lions by 7. <br />Friesen: OK, so picking the Bombers in Montreal last week was stupid. What does that make this' Winnipeg by 2. </p></em>
