We took Sammy in the other day for his 2-month shots.  The poor
little guy got 3 shots in total - 2 in one leg and the third in the
other leg.  He cried pretty good during the shots (who wouldn't')
but calmed down pretty quickly and was smiling again.  So far
we've noticed a bit of tenderness but some baby Tylenol takes care of
that.<br />
<br />
We also had him weighed and measured - he's 60 centimetres tall
(roughly 2 feet) and weighs a whopping 15 pounds, 8 ounces.  That
puts him in the 75th percentile for height but over the 95th percentile
for weight.  There's nothing wrong with that since he can use all
the weight that he can get.<br />
<br />
Overall, he's doing pretty well.  He's finally starting to settle
into a routine and he's actually sleeping 6 to 7 hours some
nights.  Auntie Tara bought him a swing on her recent visit and
that has been a godsend.  He tends to take quite a few of his naps
in the swing.  As well, he's sleeping better with the mobile in
his crib.  He used to play whenever the mobile is on, but now it
seems to be helpful at putting him to sleep in the wee hours of the
morning when Sheila has to get up with him.<br />
<br />
We've been trying to stay up to date with uploading photos.  I've
got a feed of the latest photos on the main page of aream.ca.  We
store all of our photos with Flickr.com now.  You can access them
by 1) clicking on the photos at aream.ca, or 2) going directly to
www.flickr.com/photos/aream.  Flickr has some great slideshows and
other ways to view the photos.<br />
<br />
We're planning our first mini-vacation with Sammy right now - we'll be
going to Canmore during the long weekend in November.  It'll be
his first time in the mountains, his first time in a national park and
we might even go for a quick drive across the border to take him into
BC for the first time.  We'll be sure to post photos afterwards.<br />
