There's nothing worse than working with an architect who is more concerned with developers following his plan than he is with allowing his plan to evolve.  On the flip side, there's nothing much better than working with an architect that is actively engaged with the team and helping to determine the solution.  

[Dan Bergh's take on the role of an architect](http://dearjunior.blogspot.com/2009/07/not-enforcing-architecture.html) sounds refreshing:

>So, at the bottom line: I will not enforce architecture. I will not help enforcing architecture. I think it is a bad idea to enforce architecture. I think that if you want to enforce architecture you are working in the wrong direction.
