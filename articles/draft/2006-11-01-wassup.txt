<p>Once again, I've had a huge gap between posts.  To make a boring story short, here's what I've been up to lately:</p> <ul> <li>setting up a rain barrel at home (I love it!)</li> <li>moving from BlogJet to Windows Live Writer</li> <li>making plans to move work to .Net 2.0</li> <li>registering for the <a href="http://www.devconnections.com">premier .Net conference of the year</a></li> <li>clearing mice out of my shed (at least they're not in the house)</li> <li>learning the best way to shovel snow at the new house</li> <li>mucking about with <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/">RoR</a></li> <li>considering a switch to the <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbookpro/">dark side of computers</a></li> <li>reconsidering that switch upon learning that Justice already made the switch</li> <li>dumping GreatNews for Google Reader (and dumping 90% of <a href="http://share.opml.org/viewsharedfeeds/'user_id=3050">my blog subscription</a> as well)</li> <li>dumping my email host for Hosted GMail</li> <li>going to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aream/sets/72157594320072727/">Disneyland</a></li> <li>finally uploading <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aream/sets/72157594331569051/">my Africa photos</a> to Flickr</li></ul> <p>That's about it.  I've got some plans that I'll try to post on in the near future but at least you'll still have my <a href="http://del.icio.us/mm53bar">del.icio.us feed</a> to keep an eye on what I'm playing with.</p>
