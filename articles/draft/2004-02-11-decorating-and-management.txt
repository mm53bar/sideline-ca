<p>I often need to get Sheila to do the decorating around the house. When we need to paint, she chooses the colours. When we need to hang some photos, she chooses the frames and where they go. There is no aspect of decorating that I'm not willing to let her control.</p>
<p>Do I do this because I'm a lazy bastard' No. I do it because I'm looking for efficiencies!</p>
<p>I know that if I did it, I'd be trying to get it perfect. I would hmmm and haaaa over all of the different colours - does this colour go with the couch or does that colour go with the rug' And don't even get me started on how to hang pictures on the wall!</p>
<p>I realized that in order to get something done in a shorter amount of time, I have to be willing to let someone else make the implementation decisions. I have to step back and not concern myself with how it gets done - just that it gets done at all.</p>
<p>I'm slowly learning that managing a group of people is just like that. I always knew this, but now that I actually have to do it, I'm learning just how hard it is to accept that I'm not a developer. However, if I can step back and not get involved in everything, the guys will do just as good a job as Sheila did with the decorating.</p>
