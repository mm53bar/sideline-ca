<p>On my latest Rails project, I've planned on implementing <a href="http://openid.net/" title="OpenID: an actually distributed identity system">OpenID</a> as the authentication system.  It's definitely been picking up steam lately both in the <a href="http://72.14.253.104/search?q=cache:U1E1_gBCiWUJ:www.loudthinking.com/arc/000604.html+37+signals+openid&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=4" title="OpenID makes web identities real and appealing (Loud Thinking)">Rails community</a> and the <a href="http://kveton.com/blog/2006/12/05/openid-growing-quickly/" title="Blog by Kveton &raquo; OpenID: Growing Quickly">internet in general</a>.  The more I think about it, the more I love the idea of somebody else authenticating my users!  At the very least, it saves me from writing those "forgot your password?" pages.</p>
<p>I've noticed that a lot of the OpenID-friendly sites out there don't use it as their primary authentication system.  Take a look at <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/openid/" title="OpenID">LiveJournal</a>, <a href="https://jf.highrisehq.com/login">Highrise</a>, and <a href="http://ma.gnolia.com/signin" title="Ma.gnolia.com - Find Web Sites &amp; Build Community Online">Ma.gnolia</a>.  Instead, it's another system that they've added on to their existing authentication.  I'm guessing that's because they adopted OpenID well after they had already launched their site.  I can understand why these sites wouldn't want to force their users to migrate their accounts after seeing the <a href="http://www.wired.com/techbiz/media/news/2005/08/68654" title="Flickr Fans to Yahoo: Flick Off! -">debacle that Flickr and Yahoo went through</a>.</p>
<p>However, this has made me start to wonder.  Are there really enough OpenID users out there to justify a site that <em>only</em> offers OpenID authentication?  Or should I build my own authentication system and then add OpenID as an alternative?  To me that seems like twice the work.</p>
<p>Then I saw that <a href="http://dev.aol.com/aol-and-63-million-openids" title="AOL and 63 Million OpenIDs | dev.aol.com">AOL has migrated their entire user base to OpenID</a>...all 63 million of them.  Understandably, not all of the users are <a href="http://connectid.blogspot.com/2007/02/please-delete-my-aol-openid.html" title="ConnectID: Please delete my AOL OpenID">happy to be using OpenID with AOL</a>.  But surely 63 million possible users has to be enough to justify using OpenID?  It is for me.  :)</p>
<p>In the end, I chose to go with OpenID as my sole authentication system.  Maybe it's because I'm lazy (it does save me a ton of work).  Maybe it's because Zooomr has enough faith in OpenID to <a href="http://beta.zooomr.com/login" title="Zooomr :: Experience the World Through Photos">migrate all of their users</a> away from their own proprietary login system.  Maybe it's just because the biggest software company in the world <a href="http://thomashawk.com/2007/02/microsoft-to-support-openid-log-on.html" title="Thomas Hawk's Digital Connection: Microsoft to Support OpenID Log on System">decided to support it</a>?  Or maybe it's just because my site will probably never get that many hits so what's the point of worrying? :)</p>
