<p>I'm usually a huge fan of Guy Ritchie.  Along with everyone else in the world, I thought that <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120735/">Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels</a> was a great movie.  <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0208092/">Snatch</a> took his ability to tell a good yet convoluted story to new heights.</p>
<p>Along with Ritchie, Jason Statham has usually been a guarantee of a decent movie.  <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0293662/">The Transporter</a> was a slick movie ' cheesy at times but certainly slick.  Even his over the top goalie in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0291341/">Mean Machine</a> was amusing.</p>
<p>But Revolver is pure crap.  I don't even know what the movie was about.  I think it was about a guy who went to prison and learned how to play chess before he got out and used a complicated gambling system to make money before he got a life-ending blood disease that was somehow cured by that guy from the Sopranos and the 'Hey-Ya' guy who in turn use him to advance their loansharking business.  Then there's some sort of weird ending that reminds you of Fight Club but doesn't really make any sense.  And why the hell do I want to see Ray Liotta in a Speedo'</p>
<p>I've watched <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113845/">some garbage movies</a> in my time, but I usually don't want to walk out on them.  At least three times during Revolver, I wanted to walk out.  Even Sheila couldn't sit through the whole thing'and she's the queen of bad movies!</p>
<p>My advice is to save your money.  Don't even rent this movie.</p>
