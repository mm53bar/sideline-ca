Once I actually get a little Rails app up and running, I'll need to deploy it.  I've heard lots about using <a href="http://manuals.rubyonrails.org/read/book/17">Capistrano</a> for deployment but I've mainly just filed that information away for the future.  Today I found an <a href="http://wiki.slicehost.com/doku.php?id=automated_rails_install_and_deployment_with_deprec_capistrano">article</a> and a <a href="http://www.bestechvideos.com/2007/01/14/building-a-full-rails-stack-on-ubuntu-using-depreccapistrano/">screencast</a> that both covered the same thing:  deploying rails to a <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a> server using Capistrano.  This was just too coincidental so I had to post it.  Time to fire up <a href="http://www.parallels.com/">Parallels</a>!

P.S. Here's <a href="http://nubyonrails.com/pages/shovel_dreamhost">another little Capistrano tidbit</a> for those of you that are hosting on <a href="http://www.dreamhost.com">Dreamhost</a>.
