<p>I've been looking for a gym to go to in Edmonton.  As I find my job stress increasing, I also find that I've stopped running.  That in turn has led to back problems coming back to haunt me.  Finally, I'm just not happy with the state of the chassis these days!</p>
<p>So, I've started looking for a gym.  I figure that I can sneak away during the day and get my workout in.  I never take lunch these days anyways, so I'll go for a run or a workout instead.</p>
<p>I've started to think about the criteria that I'm looking for.  Here's what I've got so far:</p>
<ul>
<li>private showers</li>
<li>towel service</li>
<li>long hours</li>
<li>open weekends</li>
<li>not too busy</li>
<li>permanent locker rental</li>
<li>some type of Pilates/yoga courses for guys</li>
<li>access to personal trainers (extra fee usually)</li></ul>
<p>A nice-to-have that I've found recently is a laundry service.  Since Sheila and I walk or bike most days of the year, it would be nice to not have to cart my running clothes back and forth.</p>
<p>In the downtown area, I've found a few different gyms.  My plan is to scope them all out and then post my findings.  Stay tuned!</p>
