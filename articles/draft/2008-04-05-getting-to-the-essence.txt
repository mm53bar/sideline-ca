<p>As I was scrolling through the different presentations at <a href="http://dlw-europe.com/">Dynamic Languages World Europe 2008</a>, I came across this in the description of Neal Ford's keynote:</p>

<blockquote>The debate over static vs. dynamic languages is really a red herring: it should be about essence vs. ceremony.</blockquote>

<p>To me, that sums up everything that I like about Ruby and extends through to why Rails is my preferred web platform.</p>
