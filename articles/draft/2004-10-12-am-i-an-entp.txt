My <a href="http://bloginality.love-productions.com/">Bloginality</a> is <a href="http://bloginality.love-productions.com/entp.php">ENTP</a>! <img src="http://my.aream.ca/blogs/images/smile4.gif" /> <p>As an ENTP, you are Extraverted, iNtuative, Thinking, and Perceiving.<br />This makes your primary focus on Extraverted Intuition with Introverted Thinking.</p><p>This is defined as a <b>NT</b> personality, which is part of Carl Jung's <u><a href="http://www.advisorteam.com/keirsey_rational.html">Rational</a></u> (Knowledge Seeking) type, and more specifically the <u>Inventors</u> or Visionary</p><p>As a weblogger, your love for a discussion may cause you to debate things more often. You might also flit from idea to idea, not completing one before going to the next. Your largest sense is intution, which makes you a good at understanding what is going on around you - and this could act to your benefit when making blog-like posts over a journal.</p><blockquote><em>hmm...I guess I do debate things, flitting from idea to idea certainly matches my personality from work...maybe I am, eh'</em></blockquote><p>For more info:<br /><a href="http://www.typelogic.com/entp.html">Typelogic - ENTP<br /></a><a href="http://www.personalitypage.com/ENTP.html">Personality Page - ENTP</a><br /><a href="http://www.haleonline.com/psych/entp.htm">Hale Online - ENTP</a><br /><a href="http://www.personalitypage.com/ENTP_car.html">Personality Page - ENTP and your career</a><br /><a href="http://www.personalitypage.com/ENTP_rel.html">Personality Page - ENTP and your relationships</a><br /><a href="http://www.socionics.com/prof/entp.htm">Socionics.com - ENTP</a><br /><a href="http://www.personalitytype.com/types/entp.html">Personality Type - ENTP</a> </p>
