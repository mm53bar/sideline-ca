<p>Reading <a href="http://www.prvsoftware.ca:8081/cs/blogs/mikes_dump/archive/2005/10/24/197.aspx">Mike's article on unsecured wireless networks</a> reminded me of my first reassignment during this lovely labour problem that TELUS is having right now.  </p>
<p>I was sent up to a group that does Assignment.  They're kind of like middlemen ' they take orders that were entered into the system by CSR's and assign them as jobs to people out in the field that actually do the work.</p>
<p>Anyways, the job was dullllllllllll.  I don't think I added enough l's to emphasize just how boring this job was.  It was even worse when they assigned us computers to use that had nothing fun installed on them.  Luckily, I had my trusty laptop with me but the cube they put me in only had one internet connection.  I couldn't really disconnect the crap computer that they had assigned me because it needed the connection for those rare situations that I actually had work to do.</p>
<p>Luckily, my laptop has built in wifi, so I took a look around for networks.  Some fellow who named his network 'Brian' obviously understood my pain and left his wireless network unsecured.  While I didn't get the fastest connection on it, I was able to fire up my rss aggregator and surf to my heart's content.</p>
<p>Thanks Brian.  You saved me from infinite boredom.  Sorry if I pushed you beyond your bandwidth limits.</p>
