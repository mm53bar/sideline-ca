<p>I just read <em><a href="http://giantrobots.thoughtbot.com/2007/4/24/don-t-be-normal">don't be normal</a></em>.  I'm torn on whether the solution is a) a beautiful example of embracing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_Principle">simplicity</a> by avoiding <a href="http://haacked.com/archive/2005/09/19/10231.aspx">premature generalization</a>, or b) an illustration of how taking <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?YouArentGonnaNeedIt">YAGNI</a> to the extreme will result in a short-sighted app.</p>

<p>Following this train of thought, I came across an article on <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com">CodingHorror</a> that discussed <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000111.html">KISS and YAGNI</a>.  This gem comes from that article:</p>
<blockquote>As developers, I think we also tend to be far too optimistic in assessing the generality of our own solutions, and thus we end up building elaborate OOP frameworks around things that may not justify that level of complexity.</blockquote>
