<p>I like this line from <a href="http://www.managementblog.org/archives/2005/10/25/wilmas-management-lesson/">Management Skills Blog</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Community leaders can make grand media pronouncements, or call in the National Guard, but ultimately, what happens has more to do with the accountability culture of the community.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Tom is talking about <a href="http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/nhc_at4.xml">Hurricane Wilma</a> coming through Florida and contrasting the preparations with what happened during Rita and Katrina.  He contends that personal responsibility has made the difference during the latest hurricanes.</p>
<p>Since Tom is a management kind of guy, he then tries to make the leap to the workplace by asking the reader about personal responsibility in their company.  Overall, a short but great article.</p>
<p>When I first started to engage in <a href="http://www.nerdherding.net/">NerdHerding</a>, I could see some of the problems and tried to address through sheer force of leadership.  That worked for some people (Group A) but didn't work for others at all (Group B).  </p>
<p>Now that I've got more experience, I know that I could have done anything with the Group A people and it would have worked.  Why'  Because they were already taking personal accountability.  All that they needed was somebody to point them in a direction and then get the hell out of the way.</p>
<p>Group B is another story.  I still struggle with Group B and how to motivate them to take some accountability.  </p>
<p>In a way, I suppose that I should appreciate Group B.  If I wasn't struggling then I wouldn't be reading all of these management blogs to find some help and guidance!</p>
