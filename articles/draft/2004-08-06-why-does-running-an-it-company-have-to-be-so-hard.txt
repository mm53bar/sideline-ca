<p>I truly don't understand the management at work. How can you run a company that builds web-based products if you have no idea how to manage a software project' How can you run an ASP-based business if you're constantly trying to integrate custom coding projects' How can you keep good people if your primary motivator is yelling'</p>
<p>The only reason that we've succeeded in the past is because of the extra effort that some people have put in. Once people stop believing, who's going to bother putting in extra effort'</p>
