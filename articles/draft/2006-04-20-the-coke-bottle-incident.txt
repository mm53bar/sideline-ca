<p><img alt="" hspace="10" src="https://id245.securedata.net/conveniencegrocery/Merchant2/graphics/00000001/00639cf.gif" align="left" vspace="10" border="0" />Since <a title="Mike should keep some parts of his life in the closet" href="http://www.prvsoftware.ca/cs/blogs/mikes_dump/archive/2006/04/16/335.aspx">Mike is in the mood for sharing stories</a>, I thought that I'd add one as well.  While my stories don't star nose goblins, they do contain an outrageously thrifty former manager.  To protect this manager's identity, we'll call him 'Duke'.  As a disclaimer, these stories may or may not involve my current place of work.</p>
<p>When the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonton_Trappers">Edmonton Trappers</a> were still here, a flood of free tickets would occasionally be distributed at work.  On one particular occasion, I went to the game along with some co-workers.  After the game, the team was giving a couple of 2'litre bottles of Coke to every spectator as they left the stadium.  I don't drink much pop but I certainly can't turn down <a title="Rye and Coke is good" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_whisky">free mix</a>.  Once I got to the front of the line, they had run out of <a title="Urban legends about Coca Cola" href="http://www.snopes.com/cokelore/cokelore.asp">Coca-Cola</a> but were passing out Pepsi.  I'm not a fan of Pepsi but I got my two bottles anyways.</p>
<p>When I got outside, I started chatting with some of my co-workers and mentioned that I don't drink Pepsi.  Duke piped up 'if you don't want them then I'll take them'.  It sounded like a good solution since they'd go to waste with me anyways.  Just as I passed off the two bottles to Duke, another co-worker came up and said that the Trappers were passing out Coke again.  I quickly said 'Hey Duke, give me those bottles so that I can exchange them'.  Duke handed 'em over and I went and exchanged the Pepsi for Coke.  Happy with my swap, I walked back to the group, said good-night and started walking to my car.</p>
<p>That's when Duke called out 'Hey, where are you going with my Coke''.  I turned around, gave Duke (who already had his own two bottles of pop in his arms) my best 'are you serious' look and then handed over the bottles.</p>
