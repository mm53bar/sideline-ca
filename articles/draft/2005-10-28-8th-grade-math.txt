<p>aaahhh'the lovely days of 8th Grade.  Back when I was a geek without even knowing what a geek was.  Back when I was old enough to take a bus to school.  Back in the days of those great Cariboo College math contests that meant a road trip to Kamloops.  Back when I first started to listen to Duran Duran and Billy Idol.  I was too cool for school.</p>
