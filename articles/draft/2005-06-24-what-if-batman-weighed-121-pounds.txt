<p>I was wondering that question as I watched <a href="http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0361862/">The Machinist</a>, starring Christian Bale among others.  This is the same Christian Bale from <a href="http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0144084/">American Psycho</a> and <a href="http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0372784/">Batman Begins</a>.  I couldn't help but stare at his skinny frame (he apparently <a href="http://www.movieweb.com/news/news.php'id=5538">dropped 60 pounds</a> for the movie).</p>
<p></p>
<p>Overall, the movie was'..weird.  It had very little storyline.  Unlike other movies, it was pretty easy to tell (watch out ' spoiler coming up) that this was a movie where the character had some sort of delusions or split personality.  It was hard to tell if the movie was trying to be dark and vague in order to accentuate the feeling of insomnia or whether it was just stuck trying to be cool.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.joblo.com/machinist.htm">Some reviews loved it</a>, but I'd have to put it in the category of 'watch it if there's nothing else available'.  This is definitely a movie you don't want to pay for as a New Release.</p>
<p>Oh yeah'there's <a href="http://www.cndb.com/movie.html'title=Machinist%2C+The+%282004%29">a mild CNDB-quality scene or two</a>, but nothing that you haven't seen in <a href="http://www.cndb.com/actor.html'name=Leigh%2C+Jennifer+Jason">other movies</a>!</p>
