<p>A lot of my recent desire to leave my current job can be summed up by this little cartoon:<img alt="" hspace="10" src="http://www.dilbert.com/comics/dilbert/archive/images/dilbert2732610051031.gif" vspace="5" border="0" /></p>
<p>I really don't see any coherent strategy at work.  Most of my first year as a software development manager has been spent fighting with the other managers to figure out what our project managers are supposed to do.  Crazy.</p>
