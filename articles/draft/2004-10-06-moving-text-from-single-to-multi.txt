Since Sheila will soon start blogging as well (trust me - she's got lots of opinions!), I'm going to move this install of .Text from a single user to a multi user.  The current URL will now become the aggregate blog containing all of our posts.  Maybe we'll also get Tanna to start typing up some stuff'
