<p>For the three of you that actually read my blog and the .5 of you that actually care to comment, you might have noticed that comments are disabled on all of my blog posts.  Contrary to what you might think, I'm not trying to stifle any negative reactions to my grandiose ideas.  If you want to lash out at anybody, there's no better target than the fine folks at Community Server.</p>
<p>Way back before the big merger into Community Server, I was using NGallery and DotText.  When they merged (along with the ASP.Net Forums), I was able to migrate my blog over to Community Server but found a few problems with the stored procedures.  When Community Server 2.0 came out recently, I did yet another upgrade, crossing my fingers that it would fix some of my stored procedure problems.  Unfortunately it didn't.</p>
<p>These stored proc problems wouldn't be a big deal except for the fact that some of my functionality seems to be limited.  For example, I cannot enable comments no matter what I do.  I have clicked every button and adjusted every setting that I can find.  I also seem to have some problems if I want to update a post.  Finally (and most vexing), if I have an image in a post then I have to make sure that the src attribute is the very first attribute in any img tag.  This behaviour was apparently fixed in some versions of Community Server but it never took effect in mine.</p>
<p>By no means do I blame the Community Server folks.  I'm sure that my problems are unique and can be attributed to the upgrade path that I have followed.  What I really need to find is some way to export my entire blog, install a fresh version of Community Server and then somehow import my entire blog.  Has anyone done this before'  If you have, make sure you leave me a comment.  :-)</p>
