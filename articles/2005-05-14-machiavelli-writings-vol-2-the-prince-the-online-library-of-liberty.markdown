<p>I saw this on <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/">Joel Spolsky's blog</a> and then noticed it at the end of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect'link_code=ur2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;tag=wwwareamcom-20&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;path=tg/detail/-/0932633439/qid=1116029743/sr=8-1/ref=pd_csp_1'v=glance%26s=books%26n=507846">Peopleware</a><img height="1" alt="" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir't=wwwareamcom-20&amp;amp;l=ur2&amp;amp;o=1" width="1" border="0" />.  I read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect'link_code=ur2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;tag=wwwareamcom-20&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;path=ASIN/0553212788/qid=1116029854/sr=2-1/ref=pd_bbs_b_2_1">The Prince</a><img height="1" alt="" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir't=wwwareamcom-20&amp;amp;l=ur2&amp;amp;o=1" width="1" border="0" /> in <a href="http://www.uvic.ca/">university</a> but haven't given it much thought since then.  I like to think that I've been an instrument of change of work and while I haven't had to worry about any kind of attacks that had the 'zeal of partisans', I have noticed that change is something that people only accept begrudgingly.  Who knew that Machiavelli was a management guru!</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>'there is nothing more difficult and dangerous, or more doubtful of success, than an attempt to introduce a new order of things in any state. For the innovator has for enemies all those who derived advantages from the old order of things, whilst those who expect to be benefited by the new institutions will be but lukewarm defenders. This indifference arises in part from fear of their adversaries who were favored by the existing laws, and partly from the incredulity of men who have no faith in anything new that is not the result of well-established experience. Hence it is that, whenever the opponents of the new order of things have the opportunity to attack it, they will do it with the zeal of partisans, whilst the others defend it but feebly, so that it is dangerous to rely upon the latter.</em></p>
