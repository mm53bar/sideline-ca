<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_Principle"><img alt="" hspace="10" src="http://static.flickr.com/49/147572221_d3efa8192d_t.jpg" align="left" vspace="10" border="0" /></a>Go and read <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/archives2/keep_your_ambitions_in_check.php">this post</a>.  Don't worry'it's a short read.</p>
<p>Now that you're back, try to list off 3 things that you could do to keep your ambitions in check.  It can't be that hard to list off 3 ways to do less, can it'</p>

<li>Stop trying to do everything myself i.e. strive to be a <a href="http://blogs.sideline.ca/archive/2006/03/02/Lazymanagersaregood.aspx">lazy manager</a></li>

<p>There.  That wasn't too hard.  It's all about keeping it simple, stupid.</p>
