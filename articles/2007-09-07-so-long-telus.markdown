title: So long TELUS
wordpress_url: http://blog.sideline.ca/2007/09/07/so-long-telus/

I've been putting off this post for a few days but I suppose it's time to start breaking with the past. I've decided to leave TELUS and take a new job as the Manager of Software Development at <a href="http://www.focus.ca">Focus Corp</a>. This wasn't an easy decision to make but now that it's made I feel better than I have in years.

My departure seems to be part of a mass exodus from <a href="http://www.telus.com/geomatics">TG</a>. I have mixed feelings about this because I've spent a lot of time here trying to build something great. I guess I should just view this as an opportunity to build something great all over again. That said, let me know if you're looking for development, project management or systems admin work.  <a href="http://www.focus.ca/html/careers.html">Focus is hiring</a>.
