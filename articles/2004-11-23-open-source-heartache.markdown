title: Open source heartache

<p>I've never had too many problems with supporting code that I've built for <a title="" href="http://www.dotnetnuke.com">DotNetNuke</a>.  Pick'Em is probably the biggest example where I've had a number of developers all submitting bug fixes and requesting new features.  Scott McCulloch has written a number of <a title="" href="http://www.dotnetnuke.com">DotNetNuke</a> modules that I've used for learning.  He recently posted about an experience he had with one developer that wanted excessive support for a free module.  It's exactly what I don't want but should probably expect as the <a title="" href="http://www.dotnetnuke.com">DotNetNuke</a> community grows.</p><p><a href="http://www.smcculloch.net/Default.aspx'tabid=1&amp;amp;newsType=ArticleView&amp;amp;articleId=60">Best Intentions</a></p><p><em></em></p>
