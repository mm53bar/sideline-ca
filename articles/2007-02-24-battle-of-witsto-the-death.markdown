I haven't thought about <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0093779/">The Princess Bride</a> (<a href="http://www.mininova.org/tor/30999">torrent</a>) for a few years but when I saw that <a href="http://unspun.amazon.com/">Amazon's UnSpun</a> had a list of <a href="http://unspun.amazon.com/list/show/3777">most quotable lines in The Princess Bride</a> I just had to check it out.  There are so many good scenes in that movie but my favourite has got to be the battle of wits.  The best quote from that scene made it to number 6 on the list.  Enjoy.
