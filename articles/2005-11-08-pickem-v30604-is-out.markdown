<p>Pick'Em v3.06.04 is now released:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>This bug has now been fixed. In addition, I've added some data to the Scoresheet control for those pools that use confidence points and/or spreads (thanks Anatol &amp;amp; Anthony).<br /><br />Grab 3.06.04 at http://www.aream.ca/DNN/PickEm/tabid/56/Default.aspx.<br /><br />As usual, backup your current database before upgrading. This version does not have any db enhancements, but I would consider the Scoresheet changes to be at beta stage and I wouldn't want anybody to introduce that into a stable pool. For those of you that are starting new pools, this build should be perfect for you.</em></p></blockquote>
