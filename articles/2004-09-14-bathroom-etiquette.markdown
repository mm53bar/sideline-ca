wordpress_url: http://blog.sideline.ca/2004/09/14/bathroom-etiquette/

<p>Have you ever seen people in the bathroom that wash their hands and then use the paper towel to open the door' Call me whacked, but I can't stand this germaphobic behaviour. Sure, there are people that don't wash their hands. Big deal! Here's a news flash - these people are also using every other door around you but I don't see you using paper towel on those doors.</p>
<p>Society these days is SOOOO neurotic about germs and bacteria. Everything that you buy is antibacterial. Kids go to school with little containers of that hand sanitizer crap. Jesus! It makes you wonder how you were ever able to survive childhood back in the days when we were so ignorant about the crawling heebee-geebees that are all over every surface.</p>
<p>So, suck it up and accept your germs like every other normal person!</p>
