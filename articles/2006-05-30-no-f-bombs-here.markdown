<p><img alt="" hspace="10" src="http://static.flickr.com/62/156578134_fdd68d9255.jpg'v=0" align="left" vspace="10" border="0" />Well, it didn't take long for <a href="http://igloocoder.com/archive/2006/05/27/328.aspx">EdmUG to respond</a> to <a href="http://igloocoder.com/archive/2006/05/27/328.aspx">my comments about the last presentation</a> but it wasn't quite in the way that I expected.  Don and I have had some offline chats about his reply and I think that we've agreed to have a UFC-style match at the next UG meeting.</p>
<p>I will continue to hold EdmUG to a much higher standard than what the DotNetWizards had.  I think that's a good thing (and I know that Don agrees with me).  A higher standard means a stronger and more knowledgeable community and it's the reason that I initially got involved with <a title="" href="http://www.edmug.net">edmug.net</a> to help launch it.  What I'm hoping is that the criticism will be better received once the group gets a few more presentations under their collective belt.</p>
<p>I'm going to leave it at that other than saying 1 good thing about the last meeting ' I liked the donuts.</p>
