<p>I've been playing with FeedBurner for a while now but haven't posted the link:  <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/FireInTheHole">http://feeds.feedburner.com/FireInTheHole</a>.  The nice thing about FeedBurner is that it ties in my <a href="http://del.icio.us/mm53bar">delicious</a> and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aream">Flickr</a> accounts into one feed. Some folks like all of the stats but I don't really get enough hits on my blog to worry about that too much.</p>
<p>Anyways, if you're one of the 3 people out there that aggregate my blog, please switch your subscription over to the FeedBurner link.  Thanks!</p>
