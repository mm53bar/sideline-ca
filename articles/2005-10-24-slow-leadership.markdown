<blockquote>
<p><em>The Romans thought every one had a genius ' a kind of innate allocation of ability and luck. Some people were blessed with the genius to be great leaders. The proof was simple: it came easily and naturally to them. If you had to struggle for something, that wasn't suitable for your genius. What would they have made of the modern notion that having to nearly kill yourself ' and give up most other pleasures in life ' is somehow required of anyone aspiring to a leadership position'</em></p></blockquote>I love this paragraph. Quite often in the past, people have told me that I'd make a good leader. I've heard it so much that I've started to accept it. But as soon as I was put into a role where I was expected to be a leader, it seems like everything got outrageously complicated. These days, I don't find a lot of fun in my job anymore. I need to change that. Maybe <a href="http://www.slowleadership.org/">Slow Leadership</a> is the way.  I'll definitely be following this blog.
