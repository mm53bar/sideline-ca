<p>No, it's not that kind of addition! <img src="http://my.aream.ca/blogs/images/smile3.gif" /></p>
<p>We finally managed to get our new couch moved in!  We had originally ordered a full sectional from Sears but upon delivery they couldn't get the sofa down our 50'year old stairwell.  It was a bit disappointing.<img src="http://my.aream.ca/blogs/images/smile10.gif" /></p>
<p>Anyways, we went back, adjusted the order to have a loveseat and 2 chaise lounges and crossed our fingers.  Last night they were delivered and once the legs were taken off they fit just nicely!  Here's some shots of Sheila in full lounge mode.</p>
