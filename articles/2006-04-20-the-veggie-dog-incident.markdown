<p><img alt="" hspace="10" src="http://www.thesoydailyclub.com/images/2_hot_dogs.jpg" align="left" vspace="10" border="0" />Due to popular demand, here's another <a href="http://blogs.sideline.ca/archive/2006/04/20/TheCokeBottleIncident.aspx">Duke</a> story.</p>
<p>Microsoft had one of their events at the Silver City movie theatre at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Edmonton_Mall">WEM</a>.  Duke and I decided to join the festivities along with the development team.  Rather than providing a lunch, Microsoft passed out coupons for the movie concession.  As a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetarian#Terminology_and_varieties_of_vegetarianism">lacto-ovo vegetarian</a>, I was disappointed to see that my coupon was for a free chicken quesidilla.  </p>
<p>Since I hadn't learned from <a href="http://blogs.sideline.ca/archive/2006/04/20/TheCokeBottleIncident.aspx">The Coke Bottle Incident</a>, I once again voiced my displeasure and indicated that I'd just go to Subway and get something.  As he did before, Duke spoke up that he would take my ticket if I wasn't going to use it.  I gave him my ticket while complaining that I'd have to buy my lunch while everyone else got a free lunch.  As I walked away, I heard Duke mention 'It's a good thing that I got this extra ticket for a quesadilla.  My ticket was for a veggie dog and that wasn't going to fill me up'.</p>
