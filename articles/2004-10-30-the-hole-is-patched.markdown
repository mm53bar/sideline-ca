title: The hole is patched

<p>Well, after <a href="http://my.aream.ca/blogs/mike/archive/2004/09/16/162.aspx">a summer of flooding</a>, ATCO finally came out and patched up our leaky foundation.  We'd been having water come in through the foundation right where the gas line comes in.  It made it a bit tough to deal with, but thank god we have a shop vac!  The thing will hold 45 litres and we were filling it every 6 minutes during some flooding.  That get's a little tiring after 3 hours!</p><p><img alt="" hspace="10" src="http://my.aream.ca/blogs/images/Image1.png" align="left" vspace="10" border="0" />Anyways, ATCO was going to fix the problem, but unfortunately we had a bathroom in the basement that covered up the gas line where it came through the foundation.  So, with no other options, I decided to call in the geeks!  Some friends and a bunch of guys from work came over to help me take down the bathroom.  Thanks to Tony, Johnny V., and Sam for their help.  A big thanks to Cyril for the electrical work, Walter for his Ferengi battle wrench and Ali for the reciprocating saw!  Of course, I can't forget Doug and Steven for showing up just in time for the French baseball.<img src="http://my.aream.ca/blogs/images/smile3.gif" /></p><p><img alt="" hspace="10" src="http://my.aream.ca/blogs/images/Image3.png" align="right" vspace="10" border="0" /><img alt="" hspace="10" src="http://my.aream.ca/blogs/images/Image2.png" align="right" vspace="10" border="0" />Now that the bathroom was done, all that was left was for ATCO to come out and patch up the hole.  I had already dug up the pipes outside, so they didn't have much to do.  They had a nice little handheld jackhammer that they used to rip off the old patch on the wall.  It didn't take too long for them to punch right through the patch so that we could see daylight coming in.  Once that was done, they wound some sort of fibrous material into the hole (it looked like a cross between steel wool and a hairball that a cat pukes up).  According to the ATCO guy, it's some sort of natural fibre that expands when it gets wet.  The last thing was to apply some <a href="http://www.abc.ph/ie4/aquaplug.htm">AquaPlug</a> on both sides and then call it a done day.</p><p>Check out <a href="http://my.aream.ca/photos/albums/40.aspx">all of the pics</a>!</p>
