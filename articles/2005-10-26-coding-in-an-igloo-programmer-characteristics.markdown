<p>Looks like the <a href="http://igloocoder.com/archive/2005/10/25/108.aspx">IglooCoder</a> could also use a <a href="http://my.aream.ca/blogs/mike/archive/2005/10/26/15167.aspx">Best Beaver</a> award in his office:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>I learned tonight that not all people take ownership in their code. Not all people can sense urgency. When you get right down to it, some people think of a job as what you fill the time between morning coffees and quitting time with. I have half a mind to put Code Complete on his desk and suggest that he read it immediately. I just don't know if he'd ever do that, and if I'd ever get it back.</em></p></blockquote>
