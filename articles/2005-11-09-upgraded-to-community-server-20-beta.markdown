title: Upgraded to Community Server 2.0 beta
wordpress_url: http://www.sideline.ca/2005/11/09/upgraded-to-community-server-20-beta/

<p>It took a bit of work last night, but I upgraded my site to the new <a href="http://communityserver.org/forums/showpost.aspx'postid=502446">Community Server v2 beta</a>.  I was desperate to do an upgrade since my previous upgrade of 1.0 to 1.1 (combined with my move to <a href="http://www.webhost4life.com/">WebHost4Life</a>)
resulted in a Community Server version that didnt have all of the
stored procs working.  This latest upgrade has hopefully fixed
those problems.</p>
<p>Hopefully this post from <a href="http://www.blogjet.com/">BlogJet</a> gets through as a test of the <a href="http://communityserver.org/forums/472579/ShowPost.aspx">MetaWebLogApi</a>. 
My biggest hope is that the built-in support for podcasting (which Im
not a big fan of) will have the side benefit of supporting <a href="http://communityserver.org/forums/497567/ShowPost.aspx">the ability to upload images and files through the api</a>.  Im not holding my breath but Im hopeful.</p>
