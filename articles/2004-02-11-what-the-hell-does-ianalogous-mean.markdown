title: What the hell does IAnalogous mean?
wordpress_url: http://blog.sideline.ca/2004/02/11/what-the-hell-does-ianalogous-mean/

Well, I'll admit that I'm trying to be cool by naming my blog after some sort of fictitious interface.

Every time I try to explain a code process (or even just a technical idea) to somebody, I tend to use analogies. ex. Building an application is like building a house - you need a good framework and if you want to add a garage in the future, you can do it but you'd better plan for it today.

So, I guess you could say that I implement the Analogous interface, eh? Maybe it just means that I'm a geek with no sense of creativity?
