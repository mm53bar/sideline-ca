<p>I don't know how he does it, but Scott Adams can often nail exactly what it's like to work at TG.  I suppose TG isn't all that different from any other IT shop but I always get a kick out of a Dilbert cartoon that matches work.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.dilbert.com/comics/dilbert/archive/dilbert-20070711.html">This week is no different</a>.</p>

<p>I usually like to print out the best of these and tape them up on my window.  Since <a href="http://www.aream.ca/2007/07/11/sara-catherine-mcclenaghan/">I'm not at work this week</a>, can somebody at TG please print this out and tape it up for me?  This is too good.</p>
