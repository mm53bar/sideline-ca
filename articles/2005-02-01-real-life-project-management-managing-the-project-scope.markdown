<p>Some good info for the beginning project manager.  At work, we don't have the big projects that would use the 8/80 rule.  The rule of thumb that I want to propose is a maximum of 4 hour chunks rather than the author's proposed maximum of 80 hour chunks.  But he's definitely talking about much bigger projects that we usually have.</p>
