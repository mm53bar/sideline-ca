From [the UK Guardian](http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2009/jul/09/nhs-computer-programme-failure):

>IT is a very immature industry. With a small project, with good people, you can get a good solution. If it's big, people typically lose control.

An interesting article on the world's biggest IT project which is currently 5 years behind schedule and budgeted to &pound;12.7 billion (~$23.8 billion CAD).  It makes [a project that's $998 million over budget](http://www.maxwideman.com/papers/boondoggle/boondoggle.pdf) look like a drop in the bucket!
