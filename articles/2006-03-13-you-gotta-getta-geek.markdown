title: You gotta getta geek
wordpress_url: http://blog.sideline.ca/2006/03/13/you-gotta-getta-geek/

<p>I'm amazed at <a href="http://www.telusgeomatics.com/">TG</a> sometimes how many times I'll get invited to a meeting on a 'new' project only to find out that this project has been floating around for a few weeks and the only reason that I'm there is to give some numbers.  Specifically, HowMuch and HowSoon.</p>
<p>What drives me nuts is that I usually only need to see one paragraph on this project (and that's usually all there is at this point) before I know that the project has severe problems.  Maybe the security wasn't considered.  Maybe scalability is a pain.  Maybe the workflow just doesn't fit a web world very nicely.  There's always something.</p>
<p>That makes the latest Dilbert so much fun.  I can imagine that I totally rain on the parade for those folks that invite me to a HowMuch, HowSoon meeting.  After all, when the meetings only consisted of people that had no knowledge or expertise in building a software product, the decisions must have been a lot quicker and easier.  :-)</p>

<p>This cartoon is timely.  I've been reading <a href="http://www.librarything.com/catalog/13010">The Best Software Writing I</a> lately and I loved the article by Rory Blyth on <a href="http://neopoleon.com/blog/posts/434.aspx">Excel as a database</a>.  I doubt that I'm the first one to say this, but that Rory dude is kind of messed up.  However, I think he's spot on with his cartoon.  Including the fangs.</p>
<p>There seems to be a theme coming out.  </p>
<p>I say this because these two articles remind me of an old post by Eric Sink entitled <a href="http://software.ericsink.com/bos/Geeks_Rule.html">Geeks Rule and MBAs Drool</a>.  Eric Sink runs SourceGear and describes in his post a number of situations where he can't understand how a non-geek could have made the decisions that he had to make.  Specifically, ''I cannot imagine facing a decision like this one without the depth of technology understanding that I have'.  Sound familiar'  He doesn't actually come up with a way to mitigate this problem for non-technical managers.  Instead, his prognosis is a bit dismal:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>'People like to wonder why software companies fail. This is one of the big reasons why.'</p></blockquote>
<p>So let's assume that all of us that are currently working in software companies will eventually be unemployed unless we are being led from the top by a geek.  How can we avoid this problem in our next job'</p>
<p>Assuming that your next job might be your own start-up, Eric does leave us with one little nugget of wisdom that might take care of Dilbert and Rory Blyth's concerns:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>'It is common to see software companies starting out with two founders, a geek and an MBA. Do you really need the MBA''</p></blockquote>
<p>Since he usually gets the last word anyways, I'll finish this post with <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/Stupidity.html">a quote from Joel Spolsky</a>.  Coincidentally, Joel is the editor of <a href="http://www.librarything.com/catalog/13010">The Best Software Writing I</a> book that I mentioned earlier.  Here's his take on the whole mess:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>'If you ask <i>me</i>, and I'm biased, <i>no software company can succeed</i> unless there is a programmer at the helm.'</p></blockquote>
<p>So I guess that pretty much sums it up, eh'  Non-technical people can't be trusted and they should all be canned.  Sounds simple enough to me.  :-)</p>
<p>P.S.  If you wanted to read the assorted essays and posts from Joel's book, you can find <a href="http://brevity.org/misc/bestswi.html">all of the links</a> online.</p>
