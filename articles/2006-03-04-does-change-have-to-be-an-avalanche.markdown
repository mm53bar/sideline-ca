title: Does change have to be an avalanche'

<p>In <a href="http://managementcraft.typepad.com/management_craft/2006/03/the_power_of_ge.html">her latest post</a>, Lisa Haneberg talks about what Getting It means to managers.  One of her points really struck home:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>'Everyday, managers ought to have an adventure called making the organization work better. If you are doing the same old, same old, you are not doing the job.'</p></blockquote>
<p>To me, this aligns well with my personal strategy to make things better than they were yesterday.  After all, improvements don't have to be huge to have an effect.</p>
<p>Too many people get caught up in making grand sweeping changes rather than focusing on small tasks that are actually achievable.  If you don't believe me, check out why <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html">Agile</a> recommends small iterations for successful software projects, <a href="http://www.marathontraining.com/marathon/m_mile.html">good marathon training plans</a> only recommend small weekly increases in mileage, and <a href="http://www.fool.com/news/commentary/2005/commentary05122203.htm">David Bach</a> recommends automating small investments as a method of getting rich.</p>
<p>Change does not have to be an avalanche but it does have to occur.</p>
<p>As usual, a couple of sports quotes probably sum it up the best:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>'You miss 100% of the shots that you never take' ' Wayne Gretzky</p>
<p>'We gotta play it one day at a time' ' Crash Davis in the movie Bull Durham</p></blockquote>
