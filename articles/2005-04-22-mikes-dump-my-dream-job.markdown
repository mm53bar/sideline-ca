wordpress_url: http://blog.sideline.ca/2005/04/22/mikes-dump-my-dream-job/

<p>A fellow developer from Geomatics is now starting to blog.  Mike and I have a lot of similar ideas but we also have enough different ideas that working with him stays interesting.  He's a big reason why I'm still moderately sane at Geomatics so it'll be good for him to get his opinions out on the net.  I guess my next goal is to figure how to get him his dream job at Geomatics! <img src="http://my.aream.ca/blogs/images/smile3.gif" /></p>
