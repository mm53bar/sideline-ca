<p>I've been sidelined lately recovering from back surgery so I haven't posted at all for the last couple of weeks.  I've been keeping up on reading my blogroll and I've started to notice a trend over the last few weeks.  Folks (at least the ones that I subscribe to) seem to be getting a bit nasty towards Microsoft.  And these same folks seem to be talking a lot about Ruby and/or Rails.</p>

<p>In no particular order, here are the links that I've picked out recently:</p>
<p><ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/IsMicrosoftLosingTheAlphaGeeks.aspx" title="Scott Hanselman's Computer Zen - Is Microsoft losing the Alpha Geeks?">Scott Hanselman - Is Microsoft losing the Alpha Geeks?</a></li>

	<li><a href="http://www.afreshcup.com/2007/6/1/progress-report" title="A Fresh Cup: Progress Report">Mike Gunderloy - Progress Report</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/RubyMicrosoft.html" title="MF Bliki: RubyMicrosoft">Martin Fowler - RubyMicrosoft</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/sam.gentile/archive/2007/05/31/microsoft-at-the-crossroads.aspx" title="Microsoft at the Crossroads - Sam Gentile">Sam Gentile - Microsoft at the Crossroads</a></li>
</ul></p>
<p>On top of all that, Microsoft isn't making many friends with their <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/nunitaddin/archive/2007/05/30/microsoft-vs-testdriven-net-express.aspx" title="Microsoft vs TestDriven.Net Express - TestDriven.NET by Jamie Cansdale">latest attacks on TestDriven.Net</a>.</p>
<p>Personally, I've been playing with RoR for 4 or 5 months now and I'm convinced that I don't want to do much .Net anymore.  However, I'm torn on whether that's realistic until Rails gains more ground locally.  Quite simply, <a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/jeremy.miller/archive/2007/05/21/thoughts-rants-and-arguments-my-devteach-2007-rollup.aspx" title="Thoughts, Rants and Arguments: My DevTeach 2007 Rollup - Jeremy D. Miller -- The Shade Tree Developer">Jeremy Miller may have phrased it best</a>:
	<blockquote>...I wanted very badly to jump into Ruby development last year when I was changing jobs because the Ruby community just has so much more energy and passion than .Net.  Alas, being a .Net developer just flat out pays too much...</blockquote></p>
<p>Have any of you out there seen much for Rails jobs in Edmonton or even in Canada?</p>
