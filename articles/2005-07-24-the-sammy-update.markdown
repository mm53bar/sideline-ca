<p>It's been a few days since I posted any news on Sam.</p>
<p>Well, he's a handful!  Just when Sheila and I thought that we had everything figured out (along with Grandma R.), he went and threw us a curveball.  While he sleeps great during the day, his sleeping at night definitely leaves something to be desired.  Sheila usually ends up staying up with him most of the night.  He seems to be going through something called cluster feeding, where he wants to eat every 45 minutes or so.  He'll eat 3 times in 2 hours and then crash for 3 or 4 hours.  As long as he gets fed, he's happy.  We want to give him some sort of structure, but right now it seems that lots of food makes him happy so that's what Sheila is doing.</p>
<p>This wouldn't be so bad except that she doesn't really get any help from me now.  With the joyous TELUS strike now in full swing, I'm working 12 hour shifts for 6 days a week to help cover off all of those overworked union employees that are now on the picket lines.  The extra $$ is good (almost 35 hours per week at something close to double time in addition to my normal paycheque), but it definitely doesn't leave me much time to help Sheila.</p>
<p>Our cloth diaper experiment is also in full swing. We committed ourselves to using a cloth diaper service for a month.  It went pretty well for the first week.  Sam gets pretty fussy about having a dirty diaper so we end up changing him fairly often.  Now that he's getting more fussy, we've found that we're starting to use disposable diapers more often at night time.  Since they absorb more of the liquid, he doesn't seem to wake up as often in the night if we use the disposables.  We've still got a few weeks left, but it's not looking good for cloth!  Maybe if he gets to be a better sleeper then we won't have a problem.</p>
<p>Anyways, that's the news.</p>
