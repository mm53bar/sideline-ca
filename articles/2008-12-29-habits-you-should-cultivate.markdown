title: Habits you should cultivate

<img class="left" title="Relaxing at work" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3122/2578512639_5820af115b_m.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="159" />Do you like to go for long coffees?  Do you have fun at work?  Do you feel that reading coding blogs at work is a complete defendable practice?  Do you often ignore email and low priority requests?  If so, you're not a slacker - you're just ahead of the curve when it comes to habits that keep you productive and motivated.  At least <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2008/LIVING/worklife/12/22/cb.7.surprising.work.habits/index.html">that's what CNN says</a>.

I've used all of these habits at one point or another.  I've probably used some too much (I have no issue with ignoring voice mail, email and low priority requests) and some too little (I have a very difficult time lowering my standards and often use it as a way to procrastinate).  However, I'm a strong believer in all of the habits that are discussed in the article.

In fact, I've found that encouraging these habits with my dev teams has ended up creating better, happier and more productive teams.  These teams take more ownership, deliver better product in shorter timelines and create great incubators for training junior devs.  It's true that these environments are ripe for abuse but I've only seen that in a few isolated situations.  In fact, in the few instances where an individual abused this type of environment, it was the team that brought it to my attention.

What I've found more common than developers abusing this environment is that upper management will only tolerate these practices as long as things are going well.  When things start to get a bit more difficult (timelines slip, budgets are too tight, et cetera), these teams of hard-working but fun-loving devs (along with me) are branded as slackers and held up as the reason that things aren't going well.

If you can find a company or a manager that can practice these habits in good times as well as bad then you've found a great place to work that truly values people.
