title: Foiled by Deus Ex 2!
date: 2003/12/10

I just downloaded Deus Ex 2 and was a bit pissed off to see that I need Pixel Shader 1.1 to run it. I've got a Radeon 7200 which apparently only supports up to DirectX8. DirectX9 is needed for Pixel Shader 1.1.

Needless to say, I won't be playing DX2 anytime soon. Maybe I'll install the original DX and have some fun with that.
