<p>I just received this in my inbox:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Could you send this email out to all of your .NET programmers, as I'm sure they might be interested in attending.</p>
<p>John Bristowe, a developer evangelist with Microsoft, will be in Edmonton on March 14th, 2006 to give a presentation on WinFX. Many of you will already be familiar with John if you had attended the Microsoft 2005 Launch Event. </p>
<p>The presentation will be on March 14th, at 6 PM, and will be at ETLC (Engineering Teaching and Learning Complex) at the University of Alberta, in room 1007 (ETL E1007). Go to <a href="http://www.campusmap.ualberta.ca/pdfmap/CampusMap.pdf">http://www.campusmap.ualberta.ca/pdfmap/CampusMap.pdf</a>  for a University of Alberta campus map.</p>
<p>WinFX is the specification for the managed (.NET) APIs for the new Windows platforms - such as Windows Vista; as well as other top-end Windows operating systems (Windows XP and Windows 2003 Server). WinFX is comprised of a superset of the .NET Framework APIs and consists of the set of interfaces exposed in Microsoft technologies such as the Windows Presentation Foundation, Windows Communications Foundation and .NET Framework 2.0 making it the future of Windows development.</p>
<p>John Bristowe is a Developer Evangelist with Microsoft Canada based in Calgary, Alberta. John is an experienced speaker and frequently presents Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN) events across Canada. Prior to joining Microsoft, John was a member of the Microsoft Regional Director (RD) and Microsoft Most Valuable Professional (MVP) programs.</p>
<p>Please pass this email to any colleagues that may be interested in attending. </p>
<p>URLs to John's blogs.<br /><a href="http://bristowe.com/blog/">http://bristowe.com/blog/</a><br /><a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/John">http://weblogs.asp.net/John</a></p>
<p>WinFX URL<br /><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/winfx/">http://msdn.microsoft.com/winfx/</a></p></blockquote>
<p>This event is being hosted by the DotNetWizards, the Edmonton .Net User Group.  Since their meetings have really sucked in the past (except for <a href="http://www.stevenrockarts.com/blog/PermaLink,guid,d8679db9-2690-4d21-a9d3-08265a1cbe55.aspx">Mr. Rockarts' presentation</a>, of course), I'm hoping that this is a sign that things will be getting better in the future.</p>
<p>Make sure you show up!  Even more importantly, make sure you spread the news to other .Net developers in town.</p>
