title: Matt Good rocks!
wordpress_url: http://blog.sideline.ca/2004/09/23/matt-good-rocks/

This is probably obvious from this new WinAmp plug-in I'm using for <a href="http://www.wbloggar.com/">w.bloggar</a>, but <a href="http://www.matthewgood.org/index.php">Matthew Good</a> rocks. Avalanche and The Audio of Being took me awhile to get into, but I can't stop listening to them. His new album, White Light Rock &amp;amp; Roll Review, hasn't really hit me as much.<br /><br />These two albums, along with Pearl Jam's Yield and Rockin' the Suburbs by Ben Folds, pretty much define 90% of what I've listened to over the last 3 or 4 years. Albums this good can just be listened to over and over again! <br /><br />P.S. On Matt Good - you've got to love a guy that can put together fantastic music like he has while also maintaining <a href="http://www.matthewgood.org/web/mblog/index.php">a pretty thick blog</a>! <br /><br />
