	Woohoo!  Over the past day, I've been playing with <a href="http://errtheblog.com/post/4268" title="err.the_blog.find_by_title('Be Dee Dee and Me')">BDD using the test/spec framework in Rails</a>.  I've just got my first spec implemented, checked in and displaying in my local install of <a href="http://cruisecontrolrb.thoughtworks.com/" title="CruiseControl.rb">CruiseControl.rb</a>.  Does it get more fun than that?</p>
