title: Giving WB Editor a try
wordpress_url: http://blog.sideline.ca/2004/10/01/giving-wb-editor-a-try/

<p>   I haven't been overly happy with w.bloggar since I installed it.  Basically,   I think that the FreeTextBox web control has a better interface!  I'm not sure   how a windows app can come up so short in that regard.  It doesn't support pasting   code, I'm having problems with my line breaks, categories aren't supported and I couldn't   even post in some text with bullets. </p><p>   I'm playing with <a href="http://www.cweblogs.com/wbeditor/">WB Editor</a> now, so   we'll see how that works. </p>
