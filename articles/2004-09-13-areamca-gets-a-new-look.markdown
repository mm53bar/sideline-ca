title: aream.ca gets a new look!
wordpress_url: http://blog.sideline.ca/2004/09/13/areamca-gets-a-new-look/

<p>I've been playing around with some DNN skins for a while, but finally found one that I like. I was trying to build something similar to <a href="http://www.simplebits.com/">SimpleBits.com</a>but found the CSS a bit ofa pain to deal with. This skin was entered in the DNN Skinning Contest and works out quite nice. I changed the top background from a garish green to the peachy gradient and took a couple of line breaks, but that's about it. I like it!</p>
