<p><strong><b><font face="Arial" size="2"><em>Dear Edmonton .NET Professionals,</em></font></b></strong></p></div>
<div>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><em>In November of 2005, the Edmonton developer community flexed its collective muscle and became the first event on Microsoft Canada's Visual Studio 2005 Launch Tour to sell out with more than 500 attendees.  Other than that event, the largest gatherings of .NET professionals in Edmonton in 2005 were in their respective places of employment.  In part it is because of this that Microsoft Canada consistently passes Edmonton by when it creates its tour schedules, Microsoft and non-Microsoft technology conferences do not occur here and no speakers of note come to the city to present on .NET technologies. </em></font></p>
<p><em><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> </font><font face="Arial" size="2">The goal of the <b>Edmonton</b><b> .Net User Group</b> is to grow the .NET professional community in the city of Edmonton through its membership.  We intend to provide the members with the opportunity to make presentations to and learn from their peers.  Additionally we will augment the interaction between members with regular presentations from renowned speakers in the worldwide community, technically focused events and conferences.  Once the local .Net community, through the success of the Edmonton .Net User Group, has shown its critical mass, we will use our size, excitement and commitment to encourage Microsoft Canada to include Edmonton on its tour schedules. </font></em></p>
<p><em><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> </font><font face="Arial" size="2">On <b>April 27<sup>th</sup> at 5:30 pm in the Milner (downtown) public library's Centennial Room</b> , the Edmonton .NET User Group will hold its official Launch Event.  This event not only is our first meeting, but is also the first of our Spring '06 Speaker Tour.  We are pleased to announce that our first speaker is <b>Jean-Paul Boodhoo from Thoughtworks in Calgary</b> who will be talking about <b>Test Driven Development (TDD) and <a href="http://asp.net/">ASP.NET</a>.</b>  </font><font color="navy"></font></em></p>
<p><em><font face="Arial" size="2">For more information about Jean-Paul and the topic he will speak on, directions to the Launch Event, and an overview of what the Edmonton .Net User Group is all about, please visit our website </font><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><a href="http://www.edmug.net/">www.edmug.net</a></font><font face="Arial" size="2">.<font color="navy">  </font>For directions to the meeting visit this </font><font color="#000099" face="Tahoma" size="2"><a href="http://www.edmug.net/Events/Directions/tabid/160/Default.aspx">page</a></font><font face="Arial" size="2">.</font><font color="navy"></font></em></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><em>Please forward this to any people that you think will be interested and we hope to see you at the Launch Event!</em></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">This is sure to kick the hell out of the previous excuse we had for a .Net user group here in town.  Go Edmug!  I'm sure that Don, Brad and the 2 Steves will do us proud.</font></p>
