title: Kelowna and Skyline pics online
wordpress_url: http://blog.sideline.ca/2004/09/13/kelowna-and-skyline-pics-online/

<p>I've now added two albums of photos to <a href="http://my.aream.ca/photos">my gallery</a>. </p>
<p>Sheila and I recently had a <a href="http://my.aream.ca/photos/albums/33.aspx">mini-roadtrip to Kelowna </a>for Jon and Lori's wedding. On our way back, we drove through the Kootenays, checking out Creston, Nelson and Kimberly. We tried to get a campsite in Canmore before heading home, but arrived too late on a Friday night. Oh well.</p>
<p>The very next weekend, we were off to <a href="http://my.aream.ca/photos/albums/32.aspx">Skyline Trail </a>in Jasper with Greg and Sandra. This was our 3rd visit to Skyline and I'm happy to report that we had fantastic weather on this trip - no snow or rain for us! Of course, the snow and rain are great for keeping mosquitos at bay. We paid our mosquito dues for the next 5 years on this trip. But the views were amazing and our new packs made it a ton more enjoyable. Now we just need new boots!</p>
