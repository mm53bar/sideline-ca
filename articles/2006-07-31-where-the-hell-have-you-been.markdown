<p><img alt="" hspace="10" src="http://www.stalbertchamber.com/images/home.jpg" align="left" vspace="10" border="0" />I was just updating my site to the latest version of <a title="" href="http://www.subtextproject.com">SubText</a> last night and noticed that I haven't posted in over a month.  I'm amazed that the community can still survive!  :-)</p>
<p>The last month has been absolutely crazy.  Where to begin'</p>
<p>After a whirlwind couple of days earlier in the summer where we bought a new house and sold our current one, we finally moved to the new place in St. Albert.  While I like the old commute (3 kms) compared to the new one (20 kms), some of the features of the new house and neighbourhood really appeal to me.  A 2000 sq. ft. house compared to a 900 sq. ft. house is kind of nice.  Putting out the garbage the night before without worrying about the bums ripping it open is pretty sweet too.  But the real kicker is that nobody has been murdered in my neighbourhood since the beginning of time.  I can't say that about <a href="http://edmsun.canoe.ca/News/Edmonton/2006/07/27/1704725-sun.html">the old neighbourhood</a>.</p>
<p>My wife has also started back to work after a year of maternity leave.  It's a bit weird getting used to that for me so I can only imagine what it's like for her.  She's adapting well though and Sam seems to be doing pretty well at his dayhome.</p>
<p>Now that Sam is progressing from being a baby to becoming a little boy, he's starting to get more activities.  Right around the time of the move, he started swimming lessons.  After two weeks of nightly lessons, he was able to pass the stringent requirements and get his certificate.  We're still working on the advanced skills like blowing bubbles in the water but I have no doubt that he'll soon master that.  :-)</p>
<p>Let's see'what else.</p>
<p>Despite the stupidly hot weather that Edmonton has experienced this summer, I've managed to pick up a chest cold.  Woe is me'</p>
<p>Anyways, I hope to get some posts out about the continuing adventures with Scrum.  If anybody out there knows of a ScrumMaster that is looking for work, send them my way!</p>
