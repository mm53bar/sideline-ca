title: Have you worked with a prick?
wordpress_url: http://www.sideline.ca/2004/10/14/have-you-worked-with-a-prick/

Not to sound too negative, but have you worked with a prick before?  Somebody that seems to undermine your efforts while at the same time criticizing that you're not doing enough?  Somebody that always seems to know the best way to do something but never actually produces anything?  It really drives me nuts sometimes.
