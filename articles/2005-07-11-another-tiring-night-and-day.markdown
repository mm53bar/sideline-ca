title: Another tiring night and day
wordpress_url: http://blog.sideline.ca/2005/07/11/another-tiring-night-and-day/

<p>Wow - I didn't know what I was talking about when in my last post about <a href="http://my.aream.ca/blogs/mike/archive/2005/07/10/15109.aspx">a tiring night and day</a>. I'll post all of the details later, but the gist is that Sheila ended up going through a normal delivery until 2:00 in the morning when it was obvious that the baby wasn't going to come out. At that point, they set up an emergency cesarean for her and were finally able to deliver the kid that way.</p>
<p>So, at 3:09 AM on July 11th, I became a dad to a 9 pound, 4 ounce baby boy.  We're still throwing around a couple of names, so he's nameless for now.</p>
<p>Poor Sheila is still resting at the hospital.  She's essentially gone through two deliveries!  She's tired (and nauseous) from the pushing and the drugs, but also incapacitated by the c-section.  Not a good combo. </p>
<p>Rest assured that I will post a million photos as soon as I can.</p>
