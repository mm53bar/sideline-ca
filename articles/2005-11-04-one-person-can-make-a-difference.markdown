title: One person can make a difference
wordpress_url: http://blog.sideline.ca/2005/11/04/one-person-can-make-a-difference/

<p>I've been creating a bit of mucky muck lately with my blog.  I've seen my career stagnate during this labour dispute as I spend all of my time out in the hinterlands of TELUS instead of being back at TG where I truly feel I can make a difference.  As the muck started to fester, I began to feel like I needed a change of workplace.</p>
<p>I now know that a change of workplace is not what I need.  What I needed was support.</p>
<p>I got a phone call from BB today.  He's a long term TELUS guy that is also a manager at TG.  After chatting with him for 23 minutes, I really feel invigorated to get back to TG and make a fresh start.</p>
<p>We are doing amazing things there.  I have been so caught up in trying to initiate change that I sometimes forget to look around at all of the things that we've done.  Rather than focus on how professional we've become, I tend to focus on how much MORE professional we could be.  However, that next step will involve other parts of TG that are not under my immediate control.  I've run into some large roadblocks there and quite often become frustrated when I try to move them.</p>
<p>I know that I have a lot of support from my developers.  I'm lucky enough that most of them are my friends outside of work and I hope that they know how much I appreciate that.  </p>
<p>But I've never really felt like I had much support from the other managers.  I haven't felt like I was getting any help in removing those roadblocks.  In fact, I found that some folks actually liked the roadblocks and were confused with my reasons for removing them.  That changed today and I have BB to thank for it.</p>
