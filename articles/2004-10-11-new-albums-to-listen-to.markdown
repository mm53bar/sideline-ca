title: New albums to listen to
wordpress_url: http://blog.sideline.ca/2004/10/11/new-albums-to-listen-to/

<p>I've grabbed a couple of new albums lately to listen to...</p><ul><li>Muse - Origin of Symmetry</li><li>William Shatner - Has Been</li><li>Ben Folds EP's</li></ul><ul><li>Speed Graphic</li><li>Sunny 16</li><li>Super D</li></ul><p>I really like the Muse album, but I kinda like that whiney musical stuff.  Maybe that's why I've liked the last couple of Matthew Good albums so much.</p><p>The verdict is still out on Captain Kirk though.  I like the Common People single but I'll have to hear the rest of the album.  I've heard that Ben Folds is heavily involved which has got to help it.  I must admit that I'm hoping that I like this album.</p><p><strong>Now playing:</strong> <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZSearch.woa/wa/advancedSearchResults'artistTerm=William Shatner">William Shatner</a> - <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZSearch.woa/wa/advancedSearchResults'songTerm=Common People&amp;amp;artistTerm=William Shatner">Common People</a></p>
