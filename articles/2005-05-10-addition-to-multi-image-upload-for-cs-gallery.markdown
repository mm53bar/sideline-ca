title: Addition to Multi-image upload for CS Gallery
wordpress_url: http://blog.sideline.ca/2005/05/10/addition-to-multi-image-upload-for-cs-gallery/

<p>After my <a href="http://my.aream.ca/blogs/mike/archive/2005/05/04/14857.aspx">previous post</a> about the mod for implementing a bulk upload into Community Server, I played around with the methods that were described in the forum posts. I'm happy to report that it worked on the first try!</p>
<p>However, it was a bit of a pain to find all of the files in their respective folders and change them.  So, once I had done the process on my dev version of CS, I compiled the solution in release mode and then copied out all of the changed files with the proper pathing.  After backing up the files in my production version of CS (gotta have a backup!<img src="http://my.aream.ca/blogs/images/smile3.gif" />), I copied the changed files and folders over top of the originals.  Bango!  It worked first time.</p>
<p>I've zipped up all of the files and folders and attached them here: <a href="http://my.aream.ca/blogs/images/MultiAdd.zip">File Attachment: MultiAdd.zip (106 KB)</a></p>
<p>Simply unpack the file (make sure you keep the folder structure!) and then copy the resulting folders and files over top of your current install of CS.  <strong>Don't apply this mod if</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>you have a non-standard install of CS (i.e. you're on a beta or have already done some mod'ing)</li>
<li>you don't use en-US as your default resource file</li>
<li>you didn't do a backup of your files first!  <img src="http://my.aream.ca/blogs/images/smile3.gif" /></li></ul>
<p>Good luck and let me know how you make out!  Big thanks to Dave and Eric for all of their hard work putting this required feature back into the Galleries!</p>
