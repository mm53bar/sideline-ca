<p>If you haven't yet read <a href="http://blog.outer-court.com/archive/2005-08-24-n14.html">why good programmers are lazy and dumb</a>, then make sure you give it a read.  Even though the title is all about shock value, the article is interesting and makes a number of good points about why you should always be looking to become more efficient and why you should be in a state of constant learning.</p>
<p>However, how does being lazy and dumb apply to a manager'  Managers don't code.  In fact, I would bet that a lot of IT managers don't even know how to code (unless you count VBA).  Can they be lazy and dumb'</p>
<p>Over the next few posts, I'll make the case for being a lazy and dumb manager.  Furthermore, I'll also justify why a good manager should also be incompetent and forgetful.  </p>
<p>Despite the amazing powers of persuasion that I'll be exerting in these posts, please keep in mind that calling your manager lazy, dumb, incompetent and forgetful is probably not a <a href="http://www.hrwhatnot.com/articles/max-pay-raise.php">good method to get you that raise that you're looking for</a>.</p>
