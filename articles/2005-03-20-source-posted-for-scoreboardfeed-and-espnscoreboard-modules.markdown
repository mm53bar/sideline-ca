title: Source posted for ScoreboardFeed and ESPNScoreboard modules
wordpress_url: http://blog.sideline.ca/2005/03/20/source-posted-for-scoreboardfeed-and-espnscoreboard-modules/

<p>I've posted the source code for both ScoreboardFeed v1.0 (for <a title="" href="http://www.dotnetnuke.com">DotNetNuke</a> 3.x) and ESPNScoreboard v2.1 (for <a title="" href="http://www.dotnetnuke.com">DotNetNuke</a> 2.x).  </p>
<p>Please note that I am no longer supporting ESPNScoreboard.  ScoreboardFeed is almost the same codebase, but has been restructured for <a title="" href="http://www.dotnetnuke.com">DotNetNuke</a> 3.x.  It also has the UrlDecode and Link fixes implemented.</p>
<p>Basically, I don't have a dev version of <a title="" href="http://www.dotnetnuke.com">DotNetNuke</a> 2.x anymore, so I won't compile any fixes for it.  If others would like to compile a fix and send it back to me for posting, I'd be happy to help with that.</p>
<p>You can find the source code and the PA's on the <a href="http://aream.ca/Default.aspx'tabid=57">ScoreboardFeed page</a> of my site.</p>
