title: Some kind of monster'  You bet!
wordpress_url: http://blog.sideline.ca/2005/01/15/some-kind-of-monster-you-bet/

<p>Holy crap ' we just finished watching the Metallica documentary, Some Kind of Monster.  What a brutal bunch of whiners those guys are!  Constant power struggles combined with constant complaining about how their feelings are getting disregarded.  This is from a freakin' heavy metal band!</p>
<p>And then it gets worse ' they bring in some bum guitarist that they kicked out of the band back in the 80's.  This guy went on to play in Megadeth or form Megadeth or something like that.  Anyways, he comes on and starts complaining about how his feelings are hurt and the whole world knows him as the guy that got kicked out of Metallica.  Grow up buddy!</p>
<p>Have you ever seen that episode of Seinfeld where Jerry befriends Keith Hernandez'  Jerry ends up relating to Keith Hernandez as a male/female relationship and hilarity ensues when Keith Hernandez asks Elaine out and Jerry gets jealous.  That's what this freaking movie reminded me of ' a bunch of millionaire bums that have nothing better to do than sit around and complain about each other and how their feelings aren't being respected by the other members of the band.</p>
<p>What a freaking waste of time.  I hope the ghost of Napster comes back to bite Metallica in the ass and truly give them something to complain about.  At least I was able to download the movie for free!! <img src="http://my.aream.ca/blogs/images/smile3.gif" /></p>
