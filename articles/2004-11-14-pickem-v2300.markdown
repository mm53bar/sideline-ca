title: Pick&#8217;Em v2.3.0.0
wordpress_url: http://blog.sideline.ca/2004/11/14/pickem-v2300/

<font size="2">
<p>Here are the latest and greatest enhancements/fixes to the Pick'Em module.  I've labelled this version as v2.3.0.0:</p>
<ul>
<li>I've implemented Dan Tindall's UpdateScores control and updated the code as required to standardize it with the rest of the code</li>
<li>I've implemented some other 3rd party development giving the pool a) an e-mail reminder control so the admin can easily e-mail users that haven't made their picks yet, and b) a scoresheet similar to the one offered at ESPN that allows users to print off one sheet that has everyone's picks for the given week. Of course, I've also updated this code to standardize it.</li>
<li>I've pulled out FormatScore, FormatSpread, CalculateScore, FormatDate and FormatTime into Common routines. Due to some quirks with calling functions from datagrids, I've had to redo some of the databinding in UpdateScores, Scoresheet, and Picks.</li>
<li>I've implemented a vCalendar class that now allows a user to export the entire PickEm schedule in Outlook .ics format</li>
<li>I've implemented Scoresheet as a ctl control with view permissions so that users can view it in fullscreen (i.e. easier to print)</li>
<li>I've moved Picks, EmailReminders, and Schedule into a Controls folder. I dynamically load these controls now similar to NewsArticles. I find that doing this really helps to sort out the UI code.</li>
<li>I've implemented Confidence Picks as a module option. Validating these picks was a bit of a challenge, but I think I found a nice way to do it.</li>
<li>I've renamed EditPickEm to PickEmGames since it was never really a screen for editing the PickEm objects.</li>
<li>I've moved the Picks UI from a Repeater to a Datagrid to simplify the dynamic inclusion of a Confidence column. This may also make it easier down the road to integrate it with your UpdateScores code.</li>
<li>I've fixed the bug that would occur when a) a user was added to a pool that was already running, or b) a pool was started when a season had already begun.</li>
<li>I've updated the logic in the Picks to show an image rather than a radio button if a) the user is admin and can't make picks, or b) the week is past the cutoff. This is MUCH better than simply disabling the submit button and much more intuitive to the end-user.</li>
<li>Added the typical <a title="" href="http://www.dotnetnuke.com">DotNetNuke</a> license to every piece of code in the module. Let me know your thoughts on this - I want to use your code and give you credit, but I want to retain ability to edit the code as I see fit to keep everything within one standard.</li>
<li>I've updated the Pool Options to allow random picks as a default if a user doesn't make any picks.</li>
<li>Lots of other little things that I'll probably have to check my source control logs to find!</li></ul>
<p> </p>
<p>I'm planning on implementing a few new things over the next little while:</p>
<ul>
<li>a button that allows a user to randomly make picks rather than waiting for the default picks to kick in</li>
<li>support for team logos (I've got some 3rd party code that I'll be refactoring for this)</li>
<li>a system for tie-breakers</li>
<li>clean up the Scoresheet (it's ugly as hell)</li>
<li>move static text to resource files in preparation for v3</li>
<li>FXCop implementation</li>
<li>constant testing and debugging!</li></ul>
<p>I'll be blogging soon about some of the code that was involved in a few of these items.</p></font>
