<p>Since Sheila got the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect'tag=wwwareamcom-20&amp;amp;path=tg/detail/-/B0000CFYCH'v=glance">Garmin Forerunner 201</a>, she's been having fun looking at all of the reports and goodies that it has on it.  Being a geek, I like the ability for it to download the data as GPS waypoints because it means that I can map them.</p><p>I've recently been directed by <a href="http://home.socal.rr.com/diverhank/ForeRunner201.htm">DiverHank's excellent list of Forerunner undocumented features</a> to Adam Schneider's sweet little online mapping tool, <a href="http://www.gpsvisualizer.com/map'form=forerunner">GPS Visualizer</a>.  Using the web page interface and a nice little program called <a href="http://www.barkingdogs.com/DayBreaker/day_breaker.htm">DayBreaker</a>, I can upload the data from a run and get a nice looking map, complete with Canadian base data!  And the price'  Free.</p><p>I've also tried using MS Streets and Trips for this because it has higher quality street data, but each point in the track comes in as an actual point rather than getting smoothed out into a line like the way GPS Visualizer treats it.</p><p>There are a number of options for GPS Visualizer - here's my favourite settings:</p><p><img alt="" hspace="0" src="http://my.aream.ca/blogs/images/Cropper_20Capture[1].jpg" align="baseline" border="1" /></p><p>Here's a sample output from these settings:</p><p><img alt="" hspace="0" src="http://my.aream.ca/blogs/images/09Oct2004_2D10K.jpg" align="baseline" border="0" /></p><p>The data gets a little jumbled where the lines cross over and there isn't much intelligence for the labels, but it still looks good.  It comes out as SVG format (which you can then convert to JPG) so you might be able to use some of those new SVG-GIS apps to work with this data once you have it.</p><p>Overall, it's a pretty sweet website.</p>
