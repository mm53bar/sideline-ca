title: What is a good ASP.Net application'
wordpress_url: http://blog.sideline.ca/2006/05/16/what-is-a-good-aspnet-application/

<p>I've been struggling lately with some pretty basic concepts.  Well, actually it's just one concept ' what is good software'  Specifically (since it's the area that I'm most interested in), what is the definition of a good ASP.Net web application'</p>
<p>When I first started coding ASP pages in the late 90's, I just thought that it was cool to get a web site up and running.  I learned how to use includes to maximize my reuse and I thought that I was pretty slick.  When .Net showed up, the bar was lowered and it was pretty easy for anybody to create a web site that was much slicker than what I could do in ASP.  What's worse is that they could do it faster too.</p>
<p>I've started to make the jump from being an ASP hack into more of a well-rounded <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming">OO</a> developer in ASP.Net.  When I say 'hack', I refer to a developer that is usually self-taught and knows enough to get something done.  I have to give some respect to this term because I would apply it to at least 90% of the developers that I've interviewed or worked with over the past 7 years.</p>
<p>As part of my attempts to leave this hack world, I've been reading.  And reading.  And reading some more.  <a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/jeremy.miller/default.aspx">Jeremy Miller</a>, <a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/scott.bellware/default.aspx">Scott Bellware</a>, <a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/jeffrey.palermo/default.aspx">Jeffrey Palermo</a>, <a href="http://www.jpboodhoo.com/blog/">Jean-Paul Boodhoo</a>, <a href="http://www.cornetdesign.com/">Cory Foy</a> and <a href="http://www.xprogramming.com/index.htm">Ron Jeffries</a> make up the bulk of this.</p>
<p>I was lucky enough to chat with Jean-Paul Boodhoo after the <a href="http://www.edmug.net/">EDMUG</a> launch event last month.  During that chat, I asked him about some of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_application_development">RAD</a> features in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.NET_Framework#.NET_Framework_2.0">.Net 2.0</a>.  Specifically, I wanted to know whether he used the <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-US/library/9a4kyhcx.aspx">ObjectDataSource</a> control.  He emphatically shook his head and said that he wouldn't touch any of the 'magical' controls that Microsoft has introduced and instead relies on his own tried and true processes.</p>
<p>That leads me to my question from the top of this post ' what is a good ASP.Net web application'  If I use ObjectDataSource am I creating a bad application'  I <a href="http://spaces.msn.com/ransel73/PersonalSpace.aspx'_c01_memberprofiletile=showdefault&amp;amp;_c=memberprofiletile">know people who use ObjectDataSources and swear by them</a> because they're easy to use and they just work.  But Jean-Paul is pretty successful without using these RAD controls.</p>
<p>I'm starting to look at this question from a different perspective ' am I building this ASP.Net web application for maintainability'  If so, I will agree with Jean-Paul and I'll adopt his approach.  It just so happens that I work on a software product so maintainability is a strong driver of what we do.  But if I worked in a project shop (i.e. most consulting businesses) and I didn't have to maintain the software, I would probably lean towards the RAD controls that Microsoft provides because they're quick and easy to use even though they might be difficult to test or debug.</p>
