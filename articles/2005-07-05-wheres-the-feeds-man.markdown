<p>Have you ever gone to some of the blogs hosted at Blogger and TypePad only to find out that you couldn't get the feed'  I have and here is some of the info that I found:</p>
<ul>
<li>Typepad:  add index.rdf to the feed url (learn more with some humour at <a href="http://funnybusiness.typepad.com/funnybusiness/2005/04/getting_the_han.html">Funny Business</a>)</li>
<li>Blogger:  add atom.xml to the feed url (more info at <a href="http://jade.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/cdb/2004/10/18/why-is/">CogDogBlog</a>)</li></ul>
<p>I'll add more as I find 'em.</p>
