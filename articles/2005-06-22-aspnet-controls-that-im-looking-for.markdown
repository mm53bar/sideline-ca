title: ASP.Net Controls that I&#8217;m looking for
wordpress_url: http://blog.sideline.ca/2005/06/22/aspnet-controls-that-im-looking-for/

<p>There's a couple of controls/classes that I'd love to get.  I'm willing to pay for one of them but I want the other one for free.</p>
<ul>
<li>Excel export ' this control/class will take a dataset/datatable and export it to Excel.  The format of the export is chosen at runtime and could be CSV, Spreadsheet XML, or just a simple Excel view (probably HTML).  Spreadsheet Xml is the toughest one to support. <a href="http://xport.mvps.org/">xPort Tools</a> does this, but they want a lot of money for me to register all of my developers plus all of my servers.  I'll keep negotiating with them.  Since this is for work, I'm willing to pay for this control.</li>
<li>iCalendar/vCalendar reader ' this control/class will read the iCalendar or vCalendar formatted files and expose the data as some sort of collection of objects.  I'd like this for my free Pick'Em pool module for DNN.  Since I'm giving away my module for free, I don't want to pay for this control or have to worry about any licensing issues.  The only one that I've really found online is the <a href="http://www.aspose.com/Products/Aspose.iCalendar/">Aspose iCalendar</a>, but <a href="http://www.aspose.com/Purchase/Aspose.iCalendar/Default.aspx">it's a little pricey</a> for me!</li></ul>
<p>Anybody know of anything else'</p>
