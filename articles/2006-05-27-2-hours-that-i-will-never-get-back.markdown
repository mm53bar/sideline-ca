title: 2 hours that I will never get back

<p><img alt="" hspace="10" src="http://static.flickr.com/55/153949946_129d6860d8_o.png" align="left" vspace="10" border="0" />As much as I appreciate what <a href="http://www.edmug.net/">EdmUG</a> is doing to rekindle the flame of the .Net community, they bombed out with their latest evening.  </p>
<p><a href="http://graysmatter.codivation.com/ROD.aspx">Rod Paddock's presentation on VS.Net project templates</a> was an absolute snooze.  Maybe it was the follow-up from <a href="http://www.edmug.net/Events/PastEvents/tabid/163/Default.aspx">JP Boodhoo's great presentation on TDD</a> but I just couldn't muster any kind of interest in Rod's topic.</p>
<p>In all honesty, I went into the meeting expecting to be a bit bored but I wanted to support the group and I also figured that I might be able to get myself some free goodies.  </p>
<p>But sitting through two hours of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_notation">Hungarian notation</a> (seriously, who prefixes their objects with 'o' anymore') and quips like 'nobody under 30 knows what a dos command window looks like' was enough to send me running for <a href="http://www.magmic.com/game'show=THK2">Texas Hold'Em on my Blackberry</a>.  The good news is that I went <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betting_%28poker%29#.22All_in.22">all in</a> when it counted and managed to win the World Series of Poker.  The bad news is that Rod's presentation went on for almost 2 hours.</p>
<p>As if this wasn't bad enough, I think that MSDN is using <a title="" href="http://www.edmug.net">edmug.net</a> as the dumping ground for all the books that London Drugs couldn't sell at their most recent computer book clearance sale.  I love free books as swag but there comes a point when free crap is still just crap.</p>
<p>Sorry guys, but I look forward to seeing how the next few presentations can improve in terms of both speakers and swag.</p>
<p>UPDATE:  I just noticed that <a href="http://igloocoder.com/archive/2006/05/26/324.aspx">Don posted on his blog</a> that I'm not the only one that wasn't impressed with the presentation.  I'm not sure if I agree when he says ''I don't think that many people would say the talk sucked'' (from the people I talked to I was able to calculate a suckage rate of 9 out of 10) but I definitely like that the group is taking action based on feedback.  It's what <a href="http://www.google.ca/search'q=dotnetwizards&amp;amp;start=0&amp;amp;ie=utf-8&amp;amp;oe=utf-8&amp;amp;client=firefox-a&amp;amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official">the previous group</a> sadly lacked and I certainly commend the <a title="" href="http://www.edmug.net">edmug.net</a> folks for their prompt actions.</p>
