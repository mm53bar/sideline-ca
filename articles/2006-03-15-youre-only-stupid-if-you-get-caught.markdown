title: You&#8217;re only Stupid if you get caught!
wordpress_url: http://www.sideline.ca/2006/03/15/youre-only-stupid-if-you-get-caught/

<p>As much as <a href="http://www.sideline.ca/2006/03/10/lazy-and-dumb-is-good-but-stupid-is-not">I chastized myself for being stupid</a>, I actually managed to get away with it.  The two remaining co-op students that I had made offers to accepted the offers.  That means that I didn't have to be in the unenviable position of retracting a rejection.</p>
<p>I could always use this lesson as a positive.  After all, I did choose 3 co-op students even though I only needed 2.  That means that there was a little bit of wiggle room available.  Some would call that good planning.</p>
<p>Others would say that sometimes it's better to be lucky than good.</p>
