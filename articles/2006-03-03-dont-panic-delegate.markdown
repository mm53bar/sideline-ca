title: Don&#8217;t panic, delegate
wordpress_url: http://www.sideline.ca/2006/03/03/dont-panic-delegate/

<p>It might be coincidental timing, but the National Post recently ran a story entitled <a href="http://www.canada.com/nationalpost/news/story.html'id=657c85ca-a8dc-4e18-98e6-1461f556e927">Don't panic, delegate</a>.  The article talks about using delegation as a way to survive in today's world of increasing responsibility and accountability.</p>
<p>What I really liked about the article was how it illustrated the problems that you'll create if you don't delegate.  Specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li>it sends a message to employees that they are not trusted to do the job well</li>
<li>it prevents employees from learning on the job</li>
<li>it prevents the manager from performing the duties that make up their job</li></ul>
<p>This is good stuff for building yourself into a <a href="http://www.sideline.ca/2006/03/02/sure-youre-lazy-and-dumb-but-what-about-incompetent-and-forgetful">lazy manager</a>.  Give the article a read.</p>
