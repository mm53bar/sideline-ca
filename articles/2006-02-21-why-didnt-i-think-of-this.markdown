title: Why didn&#8217;t I think of this'

<p>I've been using KeePass ever since I got my 1 gig USB key.  It's a great little USB-friendly app that keeps all of your passwords in one place.  I've recently started using FolderShare and love the way it synchronizs my files between home and work.  This is especially important because my work has pretty much shut down any useful ports to the outside world so I can't FTP or Remote Desktop to my home machine anymore.</p>
<p>But I never thought of <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/rosherove/archive/2006/02/16/438417.aspx">using KeePass and FolderShare together</a>.  I guess that's why I barely make more than the slurpee jockey at the local 7'11.</p>
