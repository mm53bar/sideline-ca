<p>I'm not usually too into the trends when it comes to music.  However, when I found <a href="http://dotavery.com/blog/archive/2005/01/31/2483.aspx">this blog entry</a> along with <a href="http://youknowwheretofindme.blogspot.com/2005/01/final-look-back-at-2004.html">this one</a> that talked about the top 10 records for 2004, I had to check out some of them.  After all, my idea of new music is Physical Graffiti by Led Zep (at least according to my brother Jon)!</p>
<p>I've gotta say ' <a href="http://www.arcadefire.com/">Arcade Fire</a> freaking rocks.  And they're a Canadian band!  You've gotta love it.  This is easily my new favourite album.  Hell ' I might actually go out and buy it after listening to it so much!  This is the kind of stuff that needs to be promoted by the music industry and needs to be supported by people that actually want good music.  Go get it!!!</p>
<p>I also have to say that I like the Black Keys (very bluesy for folks that like that) and Franz Ferdinand.  Interpol wasn't bad, but not exactly my stuff.  Everyone and their dog knows about the new Green Day album.  I'm going to be trying Death From Above 1979 next.  I'll let you know what I think.</p>
