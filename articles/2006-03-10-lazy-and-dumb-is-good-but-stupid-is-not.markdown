<p>OK'I've been patting myself on the back about being <a href="http://my.aream.ca/blogs/mike/archive/2006/03/02/15207.aspx">Lazy</a> and <a href="http://my.aream.ca/blogs/mike/archive/2006/03/09/15213.aspx">Dumb</a> but I was totally Stupid today.</p>
<p>We're hiring 2 co-op students here at TG.  Since I'm trying to be a good Lazy Manager, I saw this as a great opportunity to get a bunch of developers involved in the interviewing process.  Each rookie interviewer was paired with somebody that had some interview experience.  I assigned two resumes to each of the teams and they were responsible for contacting the students and conducting the interviews.</p>
<p>Once this process was finished, we all got together and rated the individual students.  We ended up with three potential recruits.  So, I sent off e-mails to the top 2 and kept the third in reserve in case we had a rejection.</p>
<p>I also had the interview teams contact the students we were rejecting to give them the bad news.  Here's where I got Stupid.</p>
<p>One of the students got back to me and said that she already had an offer that she had accepted.  No worries, I thought.  I had already planned for this and promptly contacted our #3 student.</p>
<p>As I talked with a couple of other developers, a situation came up ' what if we were turned down by another student'  I'd already asked the developers to send out their rejection e-mails to the other students.  If either of these remaining 2 students turned us down, then I'd have to send some sort of 'uhh..we made a mistake' e-mail to a developer that wasn't in our top 3!  Crap.</p>
<p>Lesson of the day ' don't actually reject co-op students until you have an acceptance from your top picks.  Too bad I had to learn that through trial and error.  </p>
