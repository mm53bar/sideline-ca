title: Personal Accountability Rehash
wordpress_url: http://www.sideline.ca/2006/04/10/personal-accountability-rehash/

<p>I can't believe that it's almost been 6 months since I had a small post on <a href="http://blogs.sideline.ca/archive/2005/10/25/Whatsyourpersonalaccountabilityonyourteam.aspx">personal accountability</a>.  In that time, I've had lots of chances to see good examples and poor examples.</p>
<p>I was waiting at the sidewalk this morning to take the crosswalk.  As the light changed to allow pedestrians across, two vehicles were stuck in the crosswalk.  </p>
<p>The first vehicle's driver wasn't paying attention that there were at least 2 car-lengths of free space in front of her.  She was blissfully watching something on the sidewalk without realizing that she could move forward and clear the area for pedestrians.</p>
<p>The second vehicle's driver was definitely aware of her situation.  Even though her window was closed, I could clearly see her yelling and screaming at the driver in front of her to move forward.  Her hands were frantically motioning, trying to sweep the first vehicle forward so that she could clear the crosswalk.</p>
<p>Now I'm guessing that the second vehicle's driver was blaming the driver in front for the predicament.  If she was taking personal accountability, she would have seen that it was her fault for entering the crosswalk area in the first place.  But, of course, it's much easier to blame others so that seems to be what she did.</p>
<p>Take some time today to evaluate areas where you could take more personal accountability.  This doesn't have to be a 'work thing'.  I'm sure that there are areas in your home life where you could do it as well.  It could be something as simple as replacing the toilet paper roll when it's low.  :-)</p>
